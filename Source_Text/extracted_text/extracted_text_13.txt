LETTER OF CONSENT
Star No. 20210692497-02'/File No. URE-73-02

In the Matter of:

Susquehanna Securities, LLC
401 City Ave., Suite 220

Bala Cynwyd, PA 19004-1122

Subject

Pursuant to the provisions of Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc. (“C2” or the “Exchange”) Rule 13.3 —
Expedited Proceeding,” Susquehanna Securities, LLC (“Susquehanna” or the “Firm”) submits this
Letter of Consent for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the alleged rule violations described
below.

The Firm neither admits nor denies that violations of Exchange Rules have been committed, and
the stipulation of facts and findings described herein do not constitute such an admission.

BACKGROUND

1. During all relevant periods herein, Susquehanna was acting as a registered Broker-
Dealer and was an Exchange Trading Permit Holder registered to conduct business
on the Exchange as a Market-Maker. The Firm’s registrations remain in effect.

Ds This matter originated from a review conducted by FINRA’s Department of Market
Regulation of the Firm’s compliance with listed position limits.

VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

Applicable Rules

3. During all relevant periods herein, Cboe Rule 8.30 as incorporated by reference by
and through C2 Chapter 5 and C2 Rule 8.30 — Position Limits* were in full force
and effect.

' This matter also incorporates findings from FINRA Matter No. 20220757260 which was merged into this matter.
? Chapter 13 of C2’s Rulebook incorporates Chapter 13 of Cboe’s Rulebook by reference, including Rule 13.3.

3 Effective November 20, 2019, Chapter 5 of C2’s Rulebook incorporated by reference Chapter 8 of Cboe’s
Rulebook, including Rule 8.30. Effective May 19, 2021, the relevant provisions of Chapter 5 of C2’s Rulebook
were incorporated into Chapter 8 of C2’s Rulebook.

DocuSign Envelope ID: A013C4EE-0187-4EAC-9E55-92EF298FE870

4. During all relevant periods (as applicable), Cboe Rule 8.30 and C2 Rule 8.30
provided, in relevant part:

...no Trading Permit Holder shall make, for any account in which it has an
interest or for the account of any customer, an opening transaction on any
exchange if the Trading Permit Holder has reason to believe that as a result
of such transaction the Trading Permit Holder or its customer would, acting
alone or in concert with others, directly or indirectly, (a) control an
aggregate position in an option contract dealt in on the Exchange in excess
of 25,000 or 50,000 or 75,000 or 200,000 or 250,000 option contracts
(whether long or short) of the put type and the call type on the same side of
the market respecting the same underlying security, combining for purposes
of this position limit long positions in put options with short positions in
call options, and short positions in put options with long positions in call
options, or such other number of option contracts as may be fixed from time
to time by the Exchange as the position limit for one or more classes or
series of options, or (b) exceed the applicable position limit fixed from time
to time by another exchange for an option contract not dealt in on the
Exchange, when the Trading Permit Holder is not a member of the other
exchange on which the transaction was effected.

5. Further, during all relevant periods (as applicable), Interpretation and Policy .04(c)
to Cboe Rule 8.30 and C2 Rule 8.30 provided, in relevant part:

An equity option position that is not delta neutral shall be subject to position
limits in accordance with this Rule 8.30 (subject to the availability of other
position limit exemptions). Only the option contract equivalent of the net
delta of such position shall be subject to the appropriate position limit. The
“options contract equivalent of the net delta” is the net delta divided by the
number of shares that equate to one option contract on a delta basis. The
term “net delta” means, at any time, the number of shares and/or other units
of trade (either long or short) required to offset the risk that the value of an
equity option position will change with incremental changes in the price of
the security underlying the option position, as determined in accordance
with a permitted pricing model.

Position Limit Violations
6. Susquehanna has availed itself of the Delta Hedge Exemption since March 19,

2008. For a firm using the Delta Hedge Exemption, any options position that is not
delta hedged remains subject to position and exercise limits.*

4 The net delta is the number of shares required (either long or short) to offset the risk that the value of an equity
options position will change with incremental changes in the price of the security underlying the options position. A
firm that is not delta neutral must be hedged to the extent that the Options Contract Equivalent of the Net Delta
(“OCEND”) stays within the applicable position limit. The Firm calculated the OCEND by using the OCC Permitted
Pricing Model. Once calculated, the OCEND must still be below the applicable position limit.

“ABC” options was 250,000 options contracts on the same side of the market.

During the trading days on January 25, 2021 through January 27, 2021, the Firm
maintained a position that was not delta neutral in “ABC” and exceeded the
applicable position limit in “ABC” options by 83,230 contracts on January 25,
2021, 76,261 contracts on January 26, 2021, and 178,608 contracts on January 27,
2021. The Firm identified the position limit overage and redressed it on January
28, 2021.

not delta neutral in “DEF” and exceeded the applicable position limit in “DEF”
