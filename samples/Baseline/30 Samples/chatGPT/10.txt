Huntleigh Securities Corporation (HSC) and Huntleigh Asset Management (Huntleigh) engaged in practices where they directed a Clearing Broker to charge excessive Margin Interest to Huntleigh's advisory clients. This resulted in both HSC and Huntleigh earning revenue they would not have otherwise acquired. Despite the higher Margin Interest rates, Huntleigh did not adequately disclose its conflicts of interest related to HSC setting the margin interest rate. Both HSC and Huntleigh benefited financially from these undisclosed conflicts, incentivizing Huntleigh to recommend margin accounts and associated securities purchases. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has identified these actions as violations and has mandated steps to address the situation, including a final accounting and certification of a Fair Fund to repay affected clients. The document concludes with a note on procedural dates and a sign-off by Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary of the SEC.
