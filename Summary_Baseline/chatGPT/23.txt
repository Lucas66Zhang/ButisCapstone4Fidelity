Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI) has been issued a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) by NYSE American LLC due to a violation of NYSE American Rule 16, which mandates adherence to principles of good business practice. The violation concerns CGMI's handling of a customer options order on March 8, 2022. Specifically, a relatively inexperienced trader on CGMIâ€™s Equity Derivatives desk improperly processed a customer order to buy 1,000 puts without clear price instruction. As a result of these findings, CGMI has consented to a censure and a fine of $45,000. While accepting the AWC, CGMI neither admits nor denies the findings. The document emphasizes that NYSE American will not bring future actions against CGMI based on the same factual findings described in this agreement. The AWC is signed and dated March 14, 2023, by representatives of both CGMI and NYSE Regulation.
