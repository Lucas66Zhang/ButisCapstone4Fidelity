FINRA found that from January 2017 to December 2018, Lighthouse Capital Group failed to establish, maintain, and enforce a supervisory system and written procedures reasonably designed to prevent general solicitations of private placements. Specifically, Lighthouse did not consistently monitor and document substantive relationships with prospective investors before soliciting them for offerings. As a result, Lighthouse was censured and fined $250,000 by FINRA. Lighthouse consented to FINRA's findings without admitting or denying them.
