The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has instituted administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. (KBCM) due to its non-compliance with Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12 when acting as an underwriter in certain primary offerings of municipal securities. This rule primarily requires underwriters in primary offerings to ensure certain agreements are in place regarding accurate and timely disclosure of events that could impact the security's tax-exempt status. KBCM has submitted an Offer of Settlement, which the SEC has accepted. Without admitting or denying the findings, KBCM has consented to the proceedings and agreed to the stipulations within the order. This includes making a payment by certified check or other specified methods to the SEC, with details provided for the payment process. If any offsets or reductions in related investor actions are granted based on the penalty paid in this order, KBCM agrees to pay the offset amount to the SEC. The document is signed by Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary of the SEC.
