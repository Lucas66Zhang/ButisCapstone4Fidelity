Baker Tilly Capital, LLC (BTC), a FINRA member since 2001 based in Madison, Wisconsin, with 8 branches and approximately 40 registered representatives, specializes in private placement investment opportunities in real estate and other alternative investments for accredited investors. In 2019, BTC permitted significant changes to two related private placement offerings without ending the offerings or refunding investors. Consequently, BTC violated Exchange Act Rule 10b-9 and FINRA Rule 2010. This violation emerged from a review by FINRA's Corporate Financing Department. BTC has agreed to the Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) proposed by FINRA, consenting to the described findings without admitting or denying them. The document concludes with procedural details and signatures from representatives of BTC and FINRA.
