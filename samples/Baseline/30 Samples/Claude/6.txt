The SEC found that from October 2019 to May 2021, The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) failed to implement its own rule change requiring it to incorporate liquidation costs into its clearing fund stress testing, resulting in an underfunding of nearly $600 million at times. OCC also failed to properly notify the SEC of this issue under Regulation SCI rules. Additionally, OCC failed to comply with its rules on specific wrong way risk charges and holiday margin requirements. As a result, OCC was censured and ordered to pay a $17 million civil penalty. OCC agreed to undertake remedial measures including revising policies, enhancing risk data governance, and prioritizing certain regulatory filings. OCC consented to the SEC's findings without admitting or denying them.
