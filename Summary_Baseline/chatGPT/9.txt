The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated cease-and-desist proceedings against HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC ("HITE") over violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M. Specifically, on May 7, 2021, HITE short-sold common stock of Pioneer Natural Resources Company in several of its private fund clients' accounts. Within Rule 105's restricted period on May 10, 2021, HITE participated in an offering, leading to ill-gotten gains across multiple funds. The total ill-gotten gains were distributed among the funds, with certain consolidations and renamings further complicating the allocation. In September 2021, an underwriter alerted HITE of a potential Rule 105 violation, but HITE failed to review its past trades for other possible breaches. During the Commission's investigation, HITE established a written Rule 105 policy, reviewed its trading history (finding no other violations), replaced its Chief Compliance Officer in November 2021, and added a compliance staff member in June 2022. Due to these findings, the SEC has ordered HITE to cease and desist from further Rule 105 violations.
