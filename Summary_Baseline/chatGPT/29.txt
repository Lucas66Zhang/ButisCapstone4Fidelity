Chatham Asset Management, LLC ("Chatham") and its Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer, Anthony Melchiorre, have been subject to an SEC order due to certain misconduct related to investments in American Media Inc. (AMI) Bonds. During a specified period, Chatham, through its control of certain funds, held significant positions in AMI Bonds, which constituted, on average, 11% of client portfolios. These bonds were largely illiquid, with limited external demand. Melchiorre was aware of the AMI Bonds' limited liquidity. Chatham's clients, especially Liquid Alternative Funds (LAFs), occasionally had to sell portfolio positions, including AMI Bonds, because of specific account parameters or daily liquidity needs. Due to these reasons and the concentrated holdings of AMI Bonds, Chatham and Melchiorre often rebalanced and conducted inter-fund trades. These actions, combined with the limited external demand, resulted in mispricing and a failure to obtain best execution for their clients, leading to violations of the Advisers Act. The SEC order concludes with provisions regarding penalties, offset conditions, and an undertaking to retain an independent compliance consultant. The document is signed by Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary of the SEC.
