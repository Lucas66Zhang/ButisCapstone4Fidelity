The text is a FINRA Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent between FINRA and respondents NatAlliance Securities and Jason Adams. From January 2019 through present, NatAlliance failed to establish reasonable supervisory systems and procedures to review bond traders' marks to ensure accurate books and records. From April 2020 to September 2020, one NatAlliance trader mismarked corporate bonds, causing the firm to file inaccurate FOCUS reports. During the same period, Adams, the trader's supervisor, failed to reasonably respond to red flags of the trader's mismarking. To settle the charges, NatAlliance agreed to a censure, $40,000 fine, and an undertaking to certify it remediated the supervisory issues. Adams agreed to a two-month suspension in all principal capacities, $5,000 fine, and required continuing education.
