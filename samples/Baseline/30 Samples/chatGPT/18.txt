Transamerica Capital, Inc. (TCI), a broker-dealer registered since 1980 and headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is the focus of a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) issued by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). TCI primarily undertakes the underwriting and distribution of variable life insurance and variable annuity products. The AWC alleges that from December 2019 to February 2021, TCI did not register or delayed the registration of over 400 call center personnel who conducted securities business on TCI's behalf, which necessitated registration. These personnel were employed by a third-party vendor and interacted with other broker-dealers and owners of Transamerica variable products. Consequently, TCI breached FINRA Rules 1210 and 2010. By accepting the AWC, TCI agrees not to deny the findings or take any inconsistent position in any FINRA-related proceedings. The document is dated March 8, 2023, and includes signatures from representatives of both TCI and FINRA.
