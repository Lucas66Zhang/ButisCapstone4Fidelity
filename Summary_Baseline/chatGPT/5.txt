The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has issued a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) to Quint Capital Corporation (QCC) and Alexander Quint. QCC, a FINRA member since November 1990, primarily deals in a retail securities business and has approximately 20 individuals registered through it. Alexander Quint, associated with FINRA since 1981, has held various roles, including a General Securities Representative, General Securities Principal, and Operations Professional. He became QCC's Chief Executive Officer in 2014. The AWC alleges that between January 2020 and March 2020, QCC and Quint allowed an individual, who was under statutory disqualification, to associate with the firm. By doing so, they violated FINRA rules. The AWC is presented to propose a settlement, and if accepted, would prevent FINRA from initiating future actions based on the same factual findings.
