Solely for the\\npurpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the\\nCommission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings\\nherein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these\\nproceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents consent\\nto the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to\\nSection 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act\\nof 1934, and Sections 203(e) and 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings,\\nand Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.\\n\\nIl.\\n\\nOn the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds! that:\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n1. This matter arises out of the conduct of certain registered representatives and a\\nsupervisory principal associated with CFI, a dually registered broker-dealer and investment adviser,\\nin connection with unsuitable recommendations and sales of complex variable interest rate\\nstructured products (“VRSPs”) to certain CFI retail brokerage customers.\\n\\n2. Between June 2016 and July 2019 (the “Relevant Period”), Atul Makharia and seven\\nother registered representatives from CFI’s Lexington, South Carolina branch office (collectively,\\nthe “CFI RRs”) recommended VRSPs to ninety-four retail customers for whom such investments\\nwere unsuitable in light of each of the specific customers’ financial situations and needs (the\\n“Specified Customers”). Makharia and the other CFI RRs made these recommendations even\\nthough they knew, or reasonably should have known, among other factors, that the Specified\\nCustomers to whom these VRSPs were recommended: were at or approaching retirement age; had\\nan annual income of less than $100,000; in most cases, had a net worth of less than $500,000; had a\\nlow or moderate risk tolerance; had investment objectives that included, or were limited to,\\n“income” and sought periodic interest payments; had moderate or high liquidity needs; had an\\ninvestment time horizon of less than fifteen years; and were unwilling to risk losing all or some of\\ntheir principal invested in the VRSPs. By making unsuitable recommendations of VRSPs to the\\nSpecified Customers, Respondent Makharia and Respondent CFI violated Sections 17(a)(2) and\\n17(a)(3) of the Securities Act. Respondent Mantei, the branch manager and owner of CFI’s\\nLexington, South Carolina branch office (the “Lexington Branch”), caused these violations.\\n\\n3. During the Relevant Period, CFI and Mantei also failed reasonably to supervise the\\nCFI RRs with a view to preventing and detecting their violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3)\\nof the Securities Act arising from the unsuitable recommendations of VRSPs to the Specified\\n\\n! The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding on any\\n\\nother person or entity in this or any other proceeding.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nCustomers. CFI failed reasonably to implement its customer-specific suitability procedures to\\ndetermine whether the CFI RRs were making the required suitability determinations prior to\\nrecommending VRSPs to the Specified Customers and that Mantei, as the branch manager and\\nsupervisory principal of the Lexington Branch, was following the procedures. For his part, Mantei\\nfailed reasonably to follow CFI’s then existing customer-specific suitability review procedures,\\nwhich required him to conduct a customer-specific suitability review of every proposed structured\\nproducts transaction, including all VRSP transactions.\\n\\n4. Additionally, from at least June 2016 to July 2019, CFI failed to make and keep\\ncertain required records relating to certain customer accounts. During this time period, CFI\\nelectronically recorded certain customer account information required under Exchange Act Rule\\n17a-3(a)(17), including the customer’s name, tax identification number, address, telephone\\nnumbers, date of birth, employment status, annual income, net worth, and investment objectives.\\nIn some instances, CFI, however, failed to maintain and preserve this information for at least six\\nyears in violation of Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rules 17a-4(e)(5) thereunder, and in a non-\\nrewritable and non-erasable format in violation of Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-\\n4(£)(2) thereunder. Further, CFI failed to make and keep current a record indicating that, for each\\nchange in a customer’s account investment objectives, CFI furnished the customer with a copy of\\nthe updated account record or alternative document containing the information required by Rule\\n17a-3(a)(17) within thirty days of CFI receiving notice of any change, in violation of Exchange Act\\nSection 17(a) and Rule 17a-3(a)(17)(i)(B)(3) thereunder.\\n\\nRespondents\\n\\n3. Centaurus, a California corporation with its principal place of business in Anaheim,\\nCalifornia, has been registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer since 1993 and as an\\ninvestment adviser since 1999. CFI has over 375 branch offices throughout the United States, and\\nover 615 registered representatives, some of whom are also investment adviser representatives.\\n\\n6. Mantei is a resident of Columbia, South Carolina. He is the founder, owner, and\\nbranch manager of Mantei & Associates, which has been affiliated with CFI since May 2015. He\\nhas been an associated person and registered with broker-dealers and/or investment advisers since\\n1982, and currently holds Series 5, 7, 24, 31, and 63 licenses.\\n\\n7. Makharia is a resident of Columbia, South Carolina. He has been a registered\\nrepresentative since 2005 and associated with CFI since May 2015. He currently holds Series 7\\nand 63 licenses.\\n\\nOther Relevant Entity\\n\\n8. Mantei & Associates (n/k/a “COLA Wealth Advisors”), a South Carolina\\nSubchapter S corporation with its principal place of business in Lexington, South Carolina, is the\\nownership entity that operates the Lexington Branch, which has been a CFI Office of Supervisory\\nJurisdiction since May 2015. Mantei founded Mantei & Associates in August 1995. Throughout\\n\\nthe Relevant Period, Mantei & Associates employed approximately fifteen registered\\nrepresentatives.\\n\\nVariable Interest Rate Structured Products\\n\\n9. The VRSPs at issue here are complex, structured securities with maturity periods of\\nfifteen years or more issued by large well-known financial institutions.2, The VRSPs initially offer\\nguaranteed periodic fixed-interest rate payments, typically for one to three years. After the fixed-\\ninterest rate periods end, however, the VRSPs switch to periodic variable-interest rate payments. The\\nvariable interest rate payments are calculated based on formulas tied to differences in Constant\\nMaturity Swap (“CMS”) rates for long-term and short-term U.S. Treasury obligations, typically\\nreferred to as the “yield curve.” Accordingly, during the variable-interest rate period, depending\\non the performance of the CMS rates, investors are not guaranteed to receive any further interest\\npayments from the VRSPs. Moreover, the VRSPs include an additional contingency before\\ninvestors can be paid any interest during the variable-interest rate period, which creates further\\ncomplexity and risk. In particular, regardless of the performance of the CMS rates, the VRSPs\\nonly make periodic variable-interest rate payments if one or more referenced indexes, such as the\\nS&P 500 and/or Russell 2000 stock indexes, do not decline more than a specified percentage (in\\nmost cases, 50%). The prospectuses for the recommended VRSPs at issue expressly disclosed the\\nrisk of non-payment of interest, stating, for example, that “there can be no assurance that\\n[investors] will receive a contingent interest payment on any interest payment date” and that “the\\nsecurities are not a suitable investment for investors who require regular fixed income payments,\\nsince the contingent interest payments are variable and may be zero.”\\n\\n10. The VRSPs are “‘principal-at-risk” securities, which means that investors can lose\\nsome or all of their invested principal if the VRSPs’ referenced securities indexes, such as the S&P\\n500 and/or Russell 2000 stock indexes, decline more than a specified percentage at maturity (in\\nmost cases, 50%). The prospectuses for several of the recommended VRSPs expressly warn:\\n“There is no minimum payment at maturity. Accordingly, investors may lose up to their entire\\ninitial investment in the securities.”\\n\\n11. The VRSPs are not listed on any securities exchange and are not guaranteed to\\ntrade in a liquid secondary market. For example, a preliminary prospectus for a VRSP offered by\\nCFI specifically warns: “The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange. Therefore,\\nthere may be little or no secondary market for the securities.... Evenif there is a secondary\\nmarket, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily... .\\nAccordingly, you should be willing to hold your securities to maturity.”\\n\\n2 The VRSPs include the following: CUSIP numbers 22546V4G8, 22546VLJ3, 22546VNQ5,\\n22548QKB0, 61760QDG6, 61760QDW1, 61760QDY7, 61760QDZ4, 61760QEA8, 61760QEEO,\\n61760QEF7, 61760QEGS, 61760QEH3, 61760QEL4, 61760QEPS, 61760QEW0, 61760QFL3,\\n61760QFN9, 61760QFQ2, 61760QFRO, 61760QFS8, 61760QFU3, 61760QFV1, 61760QFZ2,\\n61760QGY4, 61766YAM3, 61766YAP6, 61766Y ASO, 61766YAV3, 61766YAZ4, 61766YBH3, and\\n61766YBX8.\\n\\n4\\n\\nCFI RRs Made Unsuitable Recommendations of VRSPs\\n\\n12. Prior to recommending a security to a customer, a broker-dealer must satisfy its\\ncustomer-specific suitability obligations by making a determination that a particular investment is\\nsuitable for a specific customer in light of the customer’s investment profile, as determined by the\\ncustomer’s financial situation and needs, which include, among other things, age, liquidity needs,\\ninvestment objectives, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. See FJ. Kaufman and Co. of\\nVirginia and Frederick J. Kaufman, Jr., Exch. Act Rel. No. 27535, at *3, 50 S.E.C. 164 (Dec. 13,\\n1989) (Comm. Op., sustaining NASD findings) (suitability obligation “requires a broker-dealer to\\nmake a customer-specific determination of suitability and to tailor his recommendations to the\\ncustomer’s financial profile and investment objectives”). These are determinations that must be\\nmade individually for each customer relating to every recommended transaction. Broker-dealers\\nand their associated persons who make unsuitable recommendations violate the federal securities\\nlaws, including Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.\\n\\n13. During the Relevant Period, Makharia and the other CFI RRs recommended a total of\\n155 VRSPs to ninety-four Specified Customers for whom the securities were unsuitable based on\\neach individual customer’s financial situation and needs, as reflected by their age, annual income,\\nnet worth, risk tolerance, investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment time horizons, and\\ninvestment experience. Makharia made fifty of these unsuitable recommendations to thirty\\ncustomers. Information available to Makharia and the other CFI RRs, consisting of account\\nopening documents, investment profiles, and other information provided by the Specified\\nCustomers, reflected that at the time of the unsuitable recommendations the Specified Customers\\nwere: sixty-five years old or over; had an annual income of less than $100,000; in most cases, had a\\nnet worth of less than $500,000; had a low or moderate risk tolerance; had investment objectives\\nthat included, or were limited to, income and sought periodic interest payments; had moderate or\\nhigh liquidity needs; had an investment time horizon of less than fifteen years; and were unwilling\\nto risk losing all or some of their principal invested in the VRSPs.\\n\\n14. As discussed above, the VRSPs are complex structured securities with long-term\\nmaturity periods, which do not guarantee periodic interest payments following the fixed-interest\\nrate period, do not guarantee return of principal at maturity, and provide no assurance of liquidity.\\nAccordingly, at the time that Makharia and the other CFI RRs recommended the VRSPs to the\\nSpecified Customers, they knew, or should have known, that their recommendations were\\nunsuitable because the VRSPs did not align with the Specified Customers’ financial situations and\\nneeds.\\n\\n15. During the Relevant Period, Mantei, as the branch manager and supervisory\\nprincipal of the Lexington Branch, reviewed and approved each of the unsuitable VRSP\\nrecommendations and sales made by CFI RRs to the Specified Customers. Without Mantei’s\\napproval, none of these VRSP transactions would have been executed. At the time of his reviews\\nand approvals, Mantei was familiar with the Specified Customers’ financial situations and needs or\\nhad ready access to information concerning the Specified Customers’ financial situations and needs.\\nMantei was also aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of the key features and risks of the\\nVRSPs, including their long-term maturity periods, variable-interest rate risk, principal risk, and\\n\\n5\\n\\nliquidity risk. Accordingly, at the time that he reviewed and approved each of the unsuitable\\nrecommendations, Mantei knew, or reasonably should have known, that these recommendations\\nwere unsuitable because they did not align with the Specified Customers’ financial situations and\\nneeds. Mantei also knew, or reasonably should have known, that his conduct would contribute to\\nthe CFI RRs making unsuitable recommendations.\\n\\n16. As a result of the conduct described above, Makharia willfully* violated Sections\\n17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act. CFL through the conduct of Makharia and the other\\nCentaurus RRs, violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Mantei caused\\nthese violations.\\n\\nThe Lexington Branch Written Supervisory Procedures\\n\\n17. In July 2015, shortly after the Lexington Branch joined CFI, CFI established\\nwritten supervisory procedures (the “WSPs”) specifically designed to govern the Lexington\\nBranch’s recommendation and sale of structured products, including VRSPs. These WSPs were in\\neffect throughout the Relevant Period.\\n\\n18. The WSPs required the CFI RRs to comply with the customer-specific suitability\\nrequirements set forth in FINRA Rule 2111. FINRA Rule 2111 provides that, when making a\\ncustomer-specific suitability determination, the broker-dealer must consider factors such as the\\nspecific customer’s age, other investments, financial situation and needs, tax status, investment\\nobjectives, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and any\\nother information provided by the customer.\\n\\n19. The WSPs further required the CFI RRs to consider other factors, in addition to\\nthose specified in FINRA Rule 2111, when recommending structured products, including VRSPs.\\nFor example, the WSPs required the CFI RRs to conduct an additional suitability review for any\\nrecommendation of a structured product to a customer over the age of 70/2 or for a customer over\\nthe age of 594 who would be purchasing a structured product in a retirement account. These\\nadditional age-dependent suitability reviews were designed to ensure that CFI registered\\nrepresentatives in the Lexington Branch were complying with the customer-specific suitability\\nrequirements for sales of structured products to senior investors or investors nearing retirement\\nage that purchased structured products in retirement accounts. In addition, “[d]ue to the nature\\nand construct” of the structured products that the CFI RRs were recommending during the\\n\\n3 “Willfully,” for purposes of imposing relief under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and Section\\n\\n203(e) of the Advisers Act, “‘means no more than that the person charged with the duty knows what he is\\ndoing.” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969,\\n977 (D.C. Cir. 1949)). There is no requirement that the actor “also be aware that he is violating one of the\\nRules or Acts.” Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965). The decision in The Robare Group, Ltd. v.\\nSEC, which construed the term “willfully” for purposes of a differently structured statutory provision,\\ndoes not alter that standard. 922 F.3d 468, 478-79 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (setting forth the showing required to\\nestablish that a person has “willfully omit[ted]” material information from a required disclosure in\\nviolation of Section 207 of the Advisers Act).\\n\\nRelevant Period, the WSPs restricted any CFI customer from holding more than ten percent of their\\nnet worth in a single structured product. This policy was established to limit CFI customers’ risk\\nexposure to any single structured product investment.\\n\\n20. To monitor compliance with these customer-specific suitability requirements, the\\nWSPs also required that Mantei, as branch manager, conduct a further individual customer-specific\\nsuitability review of all proposed structured products transactions at the Lexington Branch,\\nincluding VRSP transactions, before each transaction was executed. The WSPs specifically\\nrequired that this review take into account the “customer’s profile, source of funds, investment\\nobjectives, time horizon level, investment experience, sophistication level, financial situation,\\nliquidity needs, concentration level for this investment sector, total holdings, and trade history” as\\nwell as “the customer’s ability to withstand any potential losses from investing in these products.”\\n\\n21. The WSPs also required specialized training for all CFI RRs “involved in the\\nsolicitation, offering, and/or supervision of structured products.” Specifically, the WSPs required\\nthat before conducting any of this activity in connection with structured products, each CFI RR\\n“must have successfully completed training deemed acceptable to the [CFI] Chief Compliance\\nOfficer, or his/her designee.”\\n\\nMantei and CFI Failed Reasonably to Supervise the CFI RRs\\n\\n22. Sections 15(b)(4)(E) and 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act and Sections 203(e)(6) and\\n203(f) of the Advisers Act provide that the Commission may sanction a registered broker-dealer or\\nsupervisor and an investment adviser or supervisor, respectively, for failing reasonably to\\nsupervise, with a view to preventing and detecting violations of the federal securities laws, another\\nperson subject to their supervision who commits such a violation. The Commission has\\nemphasized that the “responsibility of broker-dealers to supervise their employees by means of\\neffective, established procedures is a critical component in the federal investor protection scheme\\nregulating the securities markets.” SG Cowen Securities Corp., Exch. Act Rel. No. 48335 (Aug.\\n14, 2003).\\n\\nMantei Failed Reasonably to Follow the Lexington Branch WSPs\\n\\n23. During the Relevant Period, Mantei failed reasonably to follow the WSPs’\\nrequirement that Mantei conduct his own customer-specific suitability review of all proposed\\nLexington Branch structured products transactions, including VRSP transactions, to determine\\nwhether the CFI RRs were making appropriate suitability determinations prior to recommending\\nVRSPs to their respective customers. Indeed, the review that Mantei conducted for the VRSP\\ntransactions at issue here did not conform to the WSPs’ customer-specific suitability review\\nrequirements and was inadequate to prevent and detect unsuitable structured products\\nrecommendations.\\n\\n24. As part of his customer-specific suitability review, Mantei reviewed and signed each\\nVRSP trade ticket before the trade was executed. Without Mantei’s approval, none of these VRSP\\n\\ntrades would have been executed. Because of the large volume of trading at the Lexington Branch,\\n\\n7\\n\\nMantei could not, and did not, conduct any further review for many of the proposed VRSP trades.\\nThe trade ticket, standing alone, however, lacked sufficient information to enable Mantei to\\nsufficiently assess the suitability of a trade. In particular, although the trade tickets included fields\\nfor some investment profile information, including the customer’s risk tolerance, concentration level\\nfor the investment sector, and source of funds, they did not include the specific customer’s age,\\nannual income, net worth, investment objectives, time horizon level, investment experience,\\nsophistication level, liquidity needs, or total holdings, which information was collected and\\nmaintained on other records to which Mantei had ready access to during the Relevant Period.\\nMoreover, Mantei approved certain VRSP trade tickets that were incomplete, including several\\ntrade tickets that did not include any investment profile information at all.\\n\\n25. If Mantei had reasonably followed the WSP’s customer-specific suitability review\\nprocedures, it is likely that he could have prevented and detected the CFI RRs’ unsuitable\\nrecommendations.\\n\\n26. As a result of the conduct described above, Mantei failed reasonably to supervise\\nthe CFI RRs with a view to preventing and detecting their violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and\\n17(a)(3) of the Securities Act by making unsuitable recommendations of VRSPs to the Specified\\nCustomers.\\n\\nCFI Failed Reasonably to Implement the WSPs\\n\\n27s During the Relevant Period, CFI failed reasonably to implement the WSPs to\\ndetermine whether the CFI RRs were making the required customer-specific suitability\\ndeterminations prior to recommending VRSPs to the Specified Customers, and that Mantei, as the\\nbranch manager and supervisory principal of the Lexington Branch, was following the WSPs.\\n\\n28. As described above, CFI failed reasonably to implement the WSPs\\' requirement\\nthat Mantei conduct a customer-specific suitability review of all proposed Lexington Branch\\nstructured products transactions. During the Relevant Period, CFI also failed reasonably to\\nimplement the additional customer-specific suitability reviews required by the WSPs discussed in\\nParagraph 18 above. Indeed, CFI failed to implement any procedures or put any mechanisms in\\nplace to monitor whether the CFI RRs were actually conducting the additional age-dependent\\nsuitability reviews or preventing the Specified Customers from exceeding the ten percent single\\nsecurity concentration threshold for structured products. For example, the CFI RRs were not\\nrequired to document in any way their age-dependent suitability reviews or their ten percent single\\nsecurity concentration threshold calculations, and CFI did not maintain any alerts, reports, or\\nautomated systems to assist CFI in monitoring compliance with these procedures. The WSPs also\\ndid not define or provide any guidance on what the age-focused suitability reviews should entail.\\nCFIRRs could not identify what additional inquiry these reviews entailed beyond the ordinary\\nrequired suitability reviews.\\n\\n29. In addition, CFI failed to develop reasonable systems to implement its structured\\nproducts training requirements. Most significantly, at no point during the Relevant Period did CFI\\n\\ntake any steps to ensure that the CFI RRs were completing the required structured products training.\\n\\n8\\n\\nFor example, CFI failed reasonably to implement any procedures or put reasonable mechanisms in\\nplace to accurately track or record the trainings that the CFI RRs had successfully completed. As a\\nresult, during the Relevant Period, none of the CFI RRs completed any formal structured products\\ntraining, including the structured products training that CFI offered through a third-party vendor on\\nprincipal-at-risk structured products, including VRSPs.\\n\\n30. As a result of the conduct described above, CFI failed reasonably to supervise the\\nCFI RRs with a view to preventing and detecting their violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3)\\nof the Securities Act by making unsuitable recommendations of VRSPs to the Specified\\nCustomers.\\n\\nCFI Failed to Make and Keep Required Broker-Dealer Records\\n\\n31. Rule 17a-4(e)(5), promulgated under Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, requires\\na broker-dealer to “maintain and preserve in an easily accessible place ... [a]ll account record\\ninformation required pursuant to [Rule 17a-3(a)(17)] ... until at least six years after the earlier of\\nthe date the account was closed or the date on which the information was collected, provided,\\nreplaced, or updated.”* Under Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(f), broker-dealers may comply with these\\nrecordkeeping requirements through the use of electronic storage media. Importantly, however, if\\na broker-dealer uses electronic storage media to record any information required under Exchange\\nAct Rule 17a-3, including Exchange Act Rule 17a-3(a)(17), Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(f)(2)q@i)\\nspecifies that the broker-dealer must, among other things, preserve these records “exclusively in a\\nnon-rewritable, non-erasable format.”\\n\\n32. Rule 17a-3(a)(17)(i)(B)(3), promulgated under Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act,\\nrequires that, for each account with a natural person as customer or owner, a broker-dealer must\\nmake and keep current a record indicating that for “each change in the [customer or owner] account’s\\ninvestment objectives the [broker-dealer] has furnished to each customer or owner . . . a copy of the\\nupdated customer account record or alternative document with all information required to be\\nfurnished by [Rule 17a-3(a)(17)@)(B)(1)] . . . on or before the 30th day after the date the [broker-\\ndealer] received notice of any change... .”\\n\\n33. The Commission has described the records required to be kept under Exchange Act\\nRule 17a-3 as “the basic source documents” of a broker-dealer and has emphasized that the rule\\nserves as “a keystone of the surveillance of brokers and dealers by our staff and by the security\\nindustry’s self-regulatory bodies.” See Statement Regarding the Maintenance of Current Books\\nand Records by Brokers and Dealers, Exch. Act Rel. No. 10756 (April 6, 1974); Edward J.\\nMawod & Co., 46 S.E.C. 865, 873 n.39 (1977), aff\\'d, 591 F.2d 588 (10th Cir. 1979).\\n\\n4 Exchange Act Rule 17a-3(a)(17) requires, among other things, a record of a customer’s “name,\\n\\ntax identification number, address, telephone number, date of birth, employment status . . . annual\\nincome, net worth (excluding value of primary residence), and the account’s investment objectives.” The\\nCFI WSPs, which applied firm-wide, including the Lexington Branch, also required all the offices to\\nmaintain for a period of six years all records, including “new account forms” and “other materials\\nrequired to justify or clarify actions taken on behalf of a client.”\\n\\n9\\n\\n34, Every customer of CFI was required to submit a Client Agreement / New Account\\nForm to open an account with CFI. The form, which CFI required to be updated at least every\\nthirty-six months, included a customer’s name, address, occupation, net worth, annual income, tax\\nbracket, investment objectives, risk tolerance level, account time horizon, and liquidity needs,\\namongst other information. From at least June 2016 to July 2019, the Lexington Branch\\nelectronically recorded certain account information for each of its customers on a Lexington\\nBranch internal customer management system (“CMS System”). The CFI RRs also reviewed, and\\nin some cases, used the information in the CMS System to make recommendations or assist in\\nreviewing orders. The information input into the CMS System included information required to be\\nmaintained and preserved under Exchange Act Rule 17a-3(a)(17), including the customer’s name,\\ntax identification number, address, telephone numbers, date of birth, employment status, annual\\nincome, net worth, and investment objectives. Lexington Branch personnel, including the CFI\\nRRs, updated this information regularly in the CMS System as new information was received\\nduring meetings and phone calls with customers. When any of the account information was\\nupdated in the CMS System, however, the previous recorded account information for that category\\nwas permanently overwritten and not preserved in any form, including through electronic backup\\nstorage or backup tapes. As a result, CFI was unable to retrieve the previously recorded\\ninformation once it had been updated in the CMS System. CFI failed to maintain and preserve for\\nat least six years certain customer account information required pursuant to Exchange Act Rule\\n17a-3(a)(17), as required pursuant to Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-4(e)(5) thereunder.\\nIn addition, CFI failed to comply with the preservation and other electronic records requirements\\nspecified in Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(f)(2)(ii), including preserving electronic storage media in a\\nnon-rewritable, non- erasable format, as required pursuant to Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule\\n17a-4(f)(2) thereunder.\\n\\n35. From at least June 2016 to July 2019, CFI also failed to make and keep current a\\nrecord for all customers indicating that, for each change in a customer’s account investment\\nobjectives, CFI furnished the customer with a copy of the updated account record or alternative\\ndocument containing the information required by Rule 17a-3(a)(17)(i)(B)(1) within thirty days of\\nCFI receiving notice of any change pursuant to Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-\\n3(a)(17)(@)(B)(3) thereunder.\\n\\n36. As a result of the conduct described above, CFI violated Section 17(a) of the\\nExchange Act and Rules 17a-4(e)(5), 17a-4(f)(2), and 17a-3(a)(17)()(B)(3) thereunder.\\n\\n37. The disgorgement and prejudgment interest ordered in Sections IV.H. and IV.1.\\nbelow is consistent with equitable principles and does not exceed Respondents’ net profits from\\ntheir violations and will be distributed to harmed investors to the extent feasible. The Commission\\nwill hold funds paid pursuant to Sections IV.H. and IV.I. in an account at the United States\\nTreasury pending distribution. Upon approval of the distribution final accounting by the\\nCommission, any amounts remaining that are infeasible to return to investors, and any amounts\\nreturned to the Commission in the future that are infeasible to return to investors, may be\\ntransferred to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, subject to Section 21F(g)(3) of the Exchange\\nAct.\\n\\n10\\n\\nUndertakings\\n\\n38. CFI has undertaken to:\\n\\na. Retain, within thirty (30) days of the date of entry of the Order, at its own\\nexpense, the services of an Independent Consultant not unacceptable to the Division of\\nEnforcement of the Commission (“Division of Enforcement”), to review: (1) CFI’s policies\\nand procedures designed to prevent and detect unsuitable recommendations of structured\\nproducts (in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and/or\\nRegulation BJ); (ii) CFI’s systems of internal controls to implement the policies and\\nprocedures designed to prevent and detect unsuitable recommendations of structured\\nproducts; and (iii) CFI’s Lexington, South Carolina Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction\\nbranch office’s maintenance and preservation of records.\\n\\nb. Provide to the Division of Enforcement staff, within thirty (30) days of\\nretaining the Independent Consultant, a copy of an engagement letter detailing the\\nIndependent Consultant’s responsibilities, which shall include the review described above\\nin Paragraph 37(a).\\n\\nc. Require the Independent Consultant, at the conclusion of the review, which\\nin no event shall be more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of entry of the\\nOrder, to submit to CFI and the Division of Enforcement a report of the Independent\\nConsultant. The report shall address the supervisory issues described above and shall\\ninclude (1) a description of the review performed, (ii) the conclusions reached, (iii) the\\nIndependent Consultant’s recommendations for any changes or improvements to the\\npolicies, procedures, and practices of CFI, and (iv) a procedure for implementing the\\nrecommended changes or improvements to such policies, procedures, and practices.\\n\\nd. Adopt, implement, and maintain all policies, procedures, and practices\\nrecommended in the report of the Independent Consultant. As to any of the Independent\\nConsultant’s recommendations about which CFI and the Independent Consultant do not\\nagree, such parties shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement within two hundred ten\\n(210) days of the date of the entry of the Order. In the event that CFI and the Independent\\nConsultant are unable to agree on an alternative proposal, CFI and the Independent\\nConsultant shall jointly confer with the Division of Enforcement staff to resolve the matter.\\nIn the event that, after conferring with the Division of Enforcement staff, CFI and the\\nIndependent Consultant are unable to agree on an alternative proposal, CFI will abide by\\nthe recommendations of the Independent Consultant.\\n\\ne. Cooperate fully with the Independent Consultant in its review, including\\nmaking such information and documents available as the Independent Consultant may\\nreasonably request, and by permitting and requiring CFI’s employees and agents to supply\\nsuch information and documents as the Independent Consultant may reasonably request.\\n\\n11\\n\\nf. That, in order to ensure the independence of the Independent Consultant,\\nCFI (i) shall not have the authority to terminate the Independent Consultant without prior\\nwritten approval of the Director of the Division of Enforcement; and (ii) shall compensate\\nthe Independent Consultant, and persons engaged to assist the Independent Consultant, for\\nservices rendered pursuant to the Order at their reasonable and customary rates.\\n\\ng. That no later than twelve (12) months after the date of entry of the Order,\\nCFI shall direct the Independent Consultant to conduct a review of CFI’s efforts to\\nimplement each of the recommendations made by the Independent Consultant and, upon\\nthe completion of the Independent Consultant’s follow-up review, CFI shall direct the\\nIndependent Consultant to submit a report to the staff of the Division of Enforcement no\\nlater than fifteen (15) months after the date of the entry of the Order. CFI shall direct the\\nIndependent Consultant to describe in the follow-up report the details of CFI’s efforts to\\nimplement each of the Independent Consultant’s recommendations and state whether CFI\\nhas fully complied with each of the Independent Consultant’s recommendations.\\n\\nh. Require the Independent Consultant to enter into an agreement that provides\\nthat for the period of engagement and for a period of two (2) years from completion of the\\nengagement, the Independent Consultant shall not enter into any employment, consultant,\\nattorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with CFI, or any of its present or\\nformer affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity. The\\nagreement will also provide that the Independent Consultant will require that any firm with\\nwhich he/she is affiliated or of which he/she is a member, and any person engaged to assist\\nthe Independent Consultant in performance of his/her duties under this Order shall not,\\nwithout prior written consent of the Director of the Division of Enforcement enter into any\\nemployment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with\\nCFI, or any of its present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents\\nacting in their capacity as such for the period of the engagement and for a period of two\\nyears after the engagement.\\n\\ni. The reports by the Independent Consultant will likely include confidential\\nfinancial, proprietary, competitive business or commercial information. Public disclosure\\nof the reports could discourage cooperation, impede pending or potential government\\ninvestigations or undermine the objectives of the reporting requirement. For these\\nreasons, among others, the reports and the contents thereof are intended to remain and\\nshall remain non-public, except (1) pursuant to court order, (2) as agreed to by the parties\\nin writing, (3) to the extent that the Commission determines in its sole discretion that\\ndisclosure would be in furtherance of the Commission’s discharge of its duties and\\nresponsibilities, or (4) is otherwise required by law.\\n\\nj. Certify, in writing, compliance with the undertakings set forth above. The\\ncertification shall identify the undertaking(s), provide written evidence of compliance in the\\nform of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance.\\n\\nThe Division of Enforcement staff may make reasonable requests for further evidence of\\ncompliance, and CFI agrees to provide such evidence. The certification and report material\\n\\n12\\n\\nshall be submitted to Stacy L. Bogert, Associate Director, Division of Enforcement, with a\\ncopy to the Office of the Chief Counsel of the Division of Enforcement, no later than sixty\\n(60) days from the date of the completion of the undertakings.\\n\\nk. For good cause shown and upon timely application by the Independent\\nConsultant or CFI, the Division of Enforcement staff may extend any of the deadlines set\\nforth above.\\n\\n39, Mantei shall provide the Commission within thirty (30) days after the end of the six-\\nmonth limitation period described below, an affidavit attesting that he has complied fully with the\\nsanctions described in Section IV.E. below.\\n\\n40. Makharia shall provide the Commission within thirty (30) days after the end of the\\nsix-month suspension period described below, an affidavit attesting that he has complied fully with\\nthe sanctions described in Sections IV.F. and Section IV.G. below.\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nIn view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to\\nimpose the sanctions agreed to in Respondents’ Offers.\\n\\nAccordingly, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, Sections 15(b) and 21C of the\\nExchange Act, and Sections 203(e) and 203(f) of the Advisers Act, it is hereby ORDERED that:\\n\\nA.
