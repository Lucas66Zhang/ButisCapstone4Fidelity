During the period from May 1, 2019, to the present, Maxim Group LLC ("Maxim") is alleged to have violated Securities Exchange Act Rule 15Â¢3-5, also known as the "Market Access Rule". This violation pertains to Maxim's failure to establish, document, and maintain a system of risk management controls and supervisory procedures to manage its business activity's financial and regulatory risk. The firm had unreasonable credit limits and incorrect order controls. Additionally, Maxim breached NYSE Arca Rule 11.18(b) and (c) by failing to establish and maintain a supervisory system and written supervisory procedures to comply with the Market Access Rule. As a result of these findings, Maxim has consented to a censure and a fine of $40,000. This agreement, as detailed in the Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) provided by NYSE Arca, Inc., stipulates that Maxim cannot deny the charges or make statements inconsistent with the AWC in future proceedings related to these findings. The document was signed on February 27, 2023, by representatives of both Maxim and NYSE Regulation.
