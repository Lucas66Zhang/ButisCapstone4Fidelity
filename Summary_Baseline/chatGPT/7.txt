The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has issued a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) to Laidlaw & Company (UK) Ltd. (Laidlaw). Established as a FINRA member since July 2002, Laidlaw operates a full-service brokerage business with eight branch offices and employs around 75 registered representatives. The AWC details that Laidlaw operated its securities business while not maintaining the required minimum net capital during four periods between February 2018 and July 2022. This conduct violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and associated rules, as well as FINRA Rules. Additionally, Laidlaw failed to provide timely notices of net capital deficiency to the SEC and FINRA and filed an inaccurate notice in March 2019. Moreover, from January 2018 to July 2022, Laidlaw did not maintain accurate books and records regarding its net capital position and submitted multiple inaccurate Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single reports. As part of the agreement, Laidlaw is prevented from denying the findings or taking any inconsistent position in any FINRA-related proceedings.
