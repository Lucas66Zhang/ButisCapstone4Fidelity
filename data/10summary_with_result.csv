0,"CORRECTEDThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former President and CEO of Santa Clara, Calif. technology company Genesis Microchip, Inc. with insider trading. The Commission alleges that Elias Antoun, who resides in San Jose, bought Genesis stock in the brokerage accounts of a relative and a friend while in the midst of confidential merger negotiations with STMicroelectronics, one of the world's largest semiconductor companies.The SEC also charged Antoun's childhood friend, Samir Abed of Thousand Oaks, who purchased Genesis stock and options after learning of the merger negotiations from Antoun. Both Antoun and Abed, who netted profits of approximately $33,975 and $51,206, respectively, when the merger was announced, agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations.The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Jose, alleges that Genesis, a supplier of image processors for flat-panel TVs and monitors, engaged in confidential discussions in the fall of 2007 with Geneva, Switzerland-based STMicroelectronics.

1 
Plaintiff, COMPLAINT FOR PERMANENT vs. INJUNCTION AND OTHER RELIEF 
 SAMIR I. ABED and ELIAS J. ANTOUN, 
Defendants. 
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) alleges: 
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION 
1. This case involves unlawful insider trading in the securities of Silicon Valley technology 
 company Genesis Microchip, Inc. (“Genesis”) by the company’s Chief Executive Officer as well as a  childhood friend of the CEO. While in the midst of confidential negotiations for the sale of the 
/ company at a significant premium, Genesis’ President and CEO, defendant Elias J. Antoun, purchased Genesis stock in the brokerage accounts of a relative and a friend. At the same time, 
 defendant Samir I. Abed — a close friend with whom Antoun had discussed the merger in confidence 
— misappropriated the information to make his own unlawful purchases of Genesis stock and options. 

2. Atter the merger was announced to the public on December 11, 2007, Genesis’ stock price  skyrocketed 57%. Antoun sold the shares he had purchased for profits of nearly $34,000, while Abed  sold all of his Genesis stock and call option contracts for profits of over $50,000. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 3. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 21A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78u-1}. 4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(e), 21A, and 27 of the  Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(e), 78u-1, and 78aa]. Defendants Antoun and Abed, directly or  indirectly, have made use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or  of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the acts, practices and courses of  business alleged in this complaint. 5. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §  78aa] because the acts and transactions constituting the violations alleged in the Complaint occurred  within the Northern District of California. INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT 
6. Intra-district assignment to the San Jose Division is appropriate pursuant to Civil Local  Rule 3-2(c) and (e) because a substantial part of the acts and transactions giving rise to the  Commission’s claims occurred in Santa Clara county, where Genesis was headquartered during the  relevant time period. DEFENDANTS 
7. Elias J. Antoun, age 51, resides in San Jose, California. From November 30, 2004 until Genesis’ acquisition by STMicroelectronics (“STM”) in January 2008, Antoun was the President and  CEO of Genesis and a member of Genesis’ Board of Directors. 
8. Samir I. Abed, age 53, resides in Thousand Oaks, California. 
FREE, VAIN, BIN ERED 9. Genesis Microchip, Inc. was, prior to being acquired by STM in 2008, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Genesis was a supplier of display image processors in both the flat-panel TV and LCD monitor markets. Prior to January 25, 2008, Genesis’ securities were registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act [15  U.S.C. § 78/(g)] and were traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “GNSS.” 10. STMicroelectronics, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, is one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies. STM’s securities are registered with the Commission pursuant to Section  12(g) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78/(g)] and are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “STM.”  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. Antoun Purchased Genesis Stock While Aware Of Confidential Merger Discussions. 11. In early 2007, Genesis’ Board began to consider potential business partnerships or 
mergers. Genesis first approached STM in late June 2007, and on June 28 STM indicated its initial f willingness to consider a potential collaboration. 12. Antoun, as Genesis’s CEO, along with other Genesis employees, met with representatives 
of STM in Santa Clara, California in late July 2007 and again in Paris in late August 2007. Genesis } and STM signed a confidentiality agreement at the August meeting. 
13. In mid-September 2007, STM contacted Antoun to advise Genesis of STM’s interest in 
pursuing further Hoensfoms about the potential acquisition of Genesis by STM. At the end of : September 2007, STM again indicated its interest in moving forward. Antoun met with STM representatives in Geneva on October 15 to continue the confidential merger discussions. 14. Genesis received a letter of intent from STM on November 5, 2007. The letter proposed that STM would acquire Genesis through a cash tender offer at a price of $9.50 per share, a significant premium over Genesis’ then-trading price of around $6.54 per share. The companies then  began negotiating the terms of a merger agreement and STM commenced due diligence for purposes 
_ of the merger. 

15. Throughout this period, the companies’ negotiations remained conlidential. As Genesis”  CEO, Antoun was intimately familiar with each of these steps and the confidential nature of the  negotiations. 16. During the course of these negotiations, Antoun purchased Genesis stock in two separate  accounts in which he had trading authority, one opened by a relative and another opened by a friend. Antoun purchased 9,750 shares of Genesis stock in his relative’s account in multiple transactions on  November 12, 13 and 19, and December 3, 2007. Antoun also purchased 2,500 shares of Genesis stock in his friend’s account on November 12, 2007. 17. On December 5, 2007, STM revised its per share proposal to $8.25, which Genesis rejected. The companies continued their merger negotiations until they reached an agreement in  principle on Sunday, December 9, at a price of $8.65 per share. (On Friday, December 7, Genesis’  stock price had closed at $5.35 per share.) The next day, December 10, Genesis’ Board approved the  merger agreement and the parties executed the agreement. 18. On December 11, 2007, at 3:00 a.m. Eastern Time, Genesis and STM issued a joint press  release announcing the merger. That day nearly 15 million shares of Genesis stock traded, compared to 342,208 shares on December 10, 2007, and Genesis’ stock price increased 57% to close at $8.49. 19. In January 2008, Antoun tendered all of the shares he had purchased in the two accounts  from November 12 through December 3, for total profits of approximately $33,975. 20. As CEO and President of Genesis, Antoun had a duty to Genesis’ shareholders to maintain : the confidentiality of material nonpublic information about the STM merger and not to trade based on ! that information. In purchasing Genesis shares in the accounts of his relative and friend, Antoun  breached that duty.  B. Antoun Had Previously Traded On Material Nonpublic Information. 
21. Antoun’s 2007 pre-merger trades were not his first instance of insider trading in Genesis’ # stock. On July 21, 2006, Antoun purchased 900 shares of Genesis stock in his friend’s account in advance of a Genesis earnings announcement. At the time of the purchase, Antoun was privy to 
 material nonpublic information that the earnings announcement would reveal positive results. 
22. On July 27, 2006, after market close, Genesis announced the results of its fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2006. The next day, the stock opened at $13.44, 19.85% higher than the previous day’s close, and Antoun sold the 900 shares of Genesis at $13.18 per share, for a profit of approximately $2,235. 23. As CEO and President of Genesis, Antoun had a duty to Genesis’ shareholders to maintain the confidentiality of material nonpublic information about the company’s financial performance and  not to trade based on that information. In purchasing Genesis shares in the account of his friend, Antoun breached that duty. 
C. Abed Misappropriated Material Nonpublic Information About The Genesis/STM Merger From Antoun And Traded Based On That Information. 
24. Abed and Antoun became friends while attending boarding school together in the 1960s. 
 The two have had a long history of discussing confidential personal and work issues. Because of 
 their close personal relationship and history of sharing confidences, Antoun often communicated with Abed about Genesis work issues. Antoun trusted and expected that Abed would maintain the 
 confidentiality of the information shared and not trade on the information. 
25. In late August 2007, Antoun mentioned the merger to Abed after returning from a meeting  with STM in Paris. Antoun again discussed the merger with Abed on October 28, 2007, after Antoun’s return from a meeting with STM in Geneva. During that discussion, Antoun told Abed that the deal with STM was looking more and more real. As with their prior discussions of personal and 
 work-related issues, Antoun expected that the information would be kept confidential, and Abed 
 understood this expectation. 
26. On October 29 and November 2, 2007, Abed purchased 600 shares and 400 shares, respectively, of Genesis common stock. On November 14 and November 28, 2007, Abed purchased a total of 30 Genesis call option contracts. Each call option contract gave Abed the right to purchase 100 shares of Genesis stock at a specified price before the contracts expired. By purchasing call option contracts, Abed was trading based on the expectation that Genesis’ stock price would rise. 
 27. At about 7:30 p.m. on December 9, 2007, Antoun telephoned Abed and told him that the 
 deal with STM had been finalized. 
28. On December 10, 2007, before the merger was announced publicly, Abed purchased an additional 10,000 shares of Genesis common stock and 70 additional Genesis call option contracts. 29. After the merger announcement, Abed sold 40 of the Genesis call option contracts and  exercised the remainder. Abed sold 3,344 shares of Genesis stock on December 21 and 26, 2007 and  tendered the rest of his shares in January 2008. Abed’s profits on his Genesis trades totaled  approximately $51,206. 30. Each of Abed’s purchases of Genesis stock and call option contracts from October 28,  2007 through December 9, 2007, was based on material nonpublic information Abed misappropriated  from Antoun in violation of the duties of trust and confidence Abed owed Antoun based on their 1 close personal relationship and history of sharing personal and work confidences. Abed knew, or was  reckless in not knowing, that the information he received from Antoun regarding the Genesis/STM  merger was material and nonpublic. 
FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] Promulgated Thereunder by Antoun and Abed) 31.

1,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 29, 2008, it filed an emergency action to halt a Ponzi scheme and affinity fraud conducted by Creative Capital Consortium, LLC and A Creative Capital Concept$, LLC (collectively, Creative Capital), and its principal, George L. Theodule. According to the Commission's complaint, the defendants raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors in the Haitian-American community nationwide through a network of purported investment clubs Theodule directs investors to form. Also on December 29, 2008 Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, issued an order placing Creative Capital under the control of a receiver to safeguard assets, as well as other emergency orders, including temporary restraining orders and asset freezes.The Commission's complaint alleges that starting in at least November 2007, Theodule, directly and through Creative Capital, raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors, mostly Haitian-Americans. As part of the scheme, the defendants direct investors to form investment clubs solely for the purpose of funneling funds to Theodule and Creative Capital. Theodule solicits investors for Creative Capital by guaranteeing a 100% return on their investment within 90 days based on his claimed successful trading of stocks and options. The defendants also solicit investors by claiming that Creative Capital's trading profits are used to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone. In truth, Theodule has lost at least $18 million trading stocks and options just over the last year. In addition, Creative Capital merely repaid earlier investors with monies collected from new investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion. Finally, the Complaint alleges, Theodule has commingled investor funds with his personal funds and misappropriated at least $3.8 million for himself and his family.The Commission's complaint further alleges:Defendants' statements of the safety and security of investor deposits are patently false. Theodule directs prospective investors to form investment clubs with the assistance of a purported self-regulatory agency called Smart Investment Management Services, LLC (SIMS). Defendants tout SIMS' independent verification of their deposits as an added measure of safety and security. In reality, SIMS is a private company run by a former Creative Capital employee and not a regulatory entity.Defendants' claim of success trading stocks and options are also false. Of the more than $18 million deposited in brokerage accounts, Theodule has lost approximately 97% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently lost money trading in those accounts since November 2007, and has never generated net trading profits.Defendants' claims that Creative Capital's trading profits were used to fund new business ventures, some of which would benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone are false. In reality, there were no trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed went to pay earlier investors their purported profits, not fund business projects. Moreover, the Defendants misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds. In addition to the emergency relief obtained today, the Commission's complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants' ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions barring future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.Investors are advised to read the Commission's ""Affinity Fraud"" Investor Alert, which provides tips on how to avoid being a victim in an affinity fraud.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, 
Plaintiff, v. CREATIVE CAPITAL CONSORTIUM, LLC, A CREATIVE CAPITAL CONCEPTS, LLC, and GEORGE L. THEODULE, 
Defendants. / 
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF 
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges: 
INTRODUCTION 
l. The Commission brings this action to enjoin Creative Capital Consortium, LLC (“Consortium”), A Creative Capital Concept$, LLC (‘“Concept$”) (collectively “Creative Capital” or “the Companies”), and George L. Theodule from continuing to defraud investors through their violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. 
2. From at least November 2007 to the present, Theodule, directly and through the Companies, has raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors in an ongoing fraud and Ponzi scheme targeting mostly Haitian and Haitian-American investors nationwide. 
3: Theodule solicits investments for the Companies primarily during in-person presentations where he guarantees prospective investors a 100% return on their investment within 90 days based on his successful trading of stocks and options. 
4. In reality, Thcodule has lost at least $18 million trading stocks and options over 
the last year. In addition, Creative Capital merely repaid earlier investors with approximately 
$15.2 million collected from new investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion. Finally, Theodule has commingled investor funds with his personal funds and misappropriated at least $3.8 million for himself and his family members. 
5. As recently as mid-December, the Defendants have continued to solicit new investors and repeated the false claims about Theodule’s trading prowess. 
6. Through this ongoing fraudulent conduct, the Defendants have violated and, unless restrained and enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. 
DEFENDANTS 
Te Concept$ is an inactive Florida limited liability company organized in November 2007. Theodule is Concept$’s manager, along with two other individuals. Concept$ was the initial entity Theodule used to raise funds from investors until he formed Consortium. 
8. Consortium is a Florida limited liability company organized in January 2008 with its principal place of business in Lake Worth, Florida. Consortium became the primary entity through which Theodule raised investor funds and transacted business with investment clubs. 
9. Theodule, 48, currently resides in Loganville, Georgia, where he relocated from Wellington, Florida in September 2008. He is the managing member of the Companies and solicited investors. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 10. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 
27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa). 
11. The Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, and venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida because many of the Defendants’ acts and transactions constituting violations of the Exchange Act occurred in the Southern District of Florida. In addition, Creative Capita!’s principal place of business is in the Southern District of Florida, and until recently Theodule resided in the Souther District of Florida. 
12. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, have made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce, and the mails. 
THE DEFENDANTS’ FRAUDULENT INVESTMENT SCHEME 
A, Overview of the Scheme 
13. The Defendants have engaged in a fraudulent Ponzi scheme primarily targeting the US Haitian community since at least November 2007. 
14. Theodule ingratiates himself with investors by claiming he recently decided to offer his investment expertise to help build wealth in the Haitian community. He also tells investors he uses part of his trading profits to fund start-up businesses in the Haitian community, as well as business projects in Haiti and Sierra Leone. 
15. The Defendants primarily attract investors through word-of-mouth, and Theodule makes his representations during face-to-face meetings in which he touts his ability to double investor funds in just 90 days. Theodule typically depicts his investment plan and incredible profits trading stocks and options on dry erase boards or flip charts. 
16. Theodule also routinely boasts to investors about Creative Capital’s high rates of 
return, and stresses the need to begin investing as soon as possible. He told one investor he had 
made millionaires out of a significant number of people in the time it had taken her to decide to invest, and pressured her to liquidate the equity in her home to invest with him. 
17. The Defendants’ presentations also emphasize the safety and security of investing with them. They guarantee investors 100% returns with no risk, and claim to invest in the stocks and options of well-known companies such as Google, John Deere, Monsanto, Best Buy, GameStop, and others. 
18. Since the commencement of the investment scheme, the Defendants have raised more than $23.4 million from thousands of investors nationwide. 
B. Investor Funds Are Also Raised Through a Network of Investment Clubs 
19. To add to investors’ sense of security, Theodule directs prospective investors to form “investment clubs,” which a purported self-regulatory agency, Smart Investment Management Services, LLC (“SIMS”), helps the investors form. This entity also supposedly protects investors through independent verification of their deposits. 
20. ‘In reality, SIMS is a private company run by a former Creative Capital employee and not a regulatory entity. 
21. The investment clubs pool investor funds and send them to Creative Capital for a 90-day period, during which Theodule purportedly trades stocks and options on behalf of the investment club members. 
22. Unlike a real investment club, the members do not participate in making investment decisions, rarely have club meetings, and deposit funds exclusively with the Defendants. 
23. Thus, the investment clubs serve principally as vehicles to funnel funds to 
Theodule and Creative Capital. 
24. The investment clubs typically require a minimum $1,000 investment per investor, which the investor may not withdraw for the 90-day investment period. 
25. The investment clubs deposit the investors’ funds into their own bank accounts, pool the funds, and remit the moncy to Creative Capital, minus a 10% club commission. 
26. At the end of the 90-day investment period, when the Defendants have purportedly doubled the investment amount, they supposedly return the principal and profits back to the investment clubs, minus a 40% commission on the profits. Prior to distributing the proceeds back to the individual club members, the investment clubs typically charge a second 10% commission on the principal. 
C Fraudulent Misrepresentations and Omissions 
Qs In connection with Defendants’ fraudulent Ponzi scheme, they have made and continue to make numerous material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Creative Capital’s business, Theodule’s stock trading, and the use of investor funds. 
28. For example, Theodule’s claim of success trading stocks and options is demonstrably false. Of the more than $18.3 million deposited in brokerage accounts Theodule controls, he has lost approximately 97% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently lost money trading in those accounts since November 2007, and has never generated net trading profits. 
29.  However, Creative Capital hid those losses from current and prospective investors, paying principal and purported profits to existing investment clubs and individual 
investors of approximately $15.2 million from new investor funds. 
30. Additionally, Theodule claims he uses trading profits to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone. 
31. In reality, there were no trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed went to pay carlicr investors their purported profits, not fund business projects. 
32.  Theodule’s representations about the safety and security of investors’ funds are also patently false. SIMS is not a regulatory agency, but rather a private entity that was, until recently, headed by a former Creative Capital employee. 
33. Further, there is no evidence that SIMS has access to or otherwise verifies the deposits to ensure the safety of investor funds. To the contrary, Thcodule has commingled investor funds extensively with his own personal accounts and has misappropriated at least $3.8 million. This includes net transfers of at least $1.7 miltion to his personal bank accounts, cash withdrawals of more than $1.5 million and more than $600,000 for apparent personal expenses such as two luxury vehicles, credit card bills, a wedding payment, and a house down payment. 
34.  Thus, Theodule misrepresented the safety and security of the Creative Capital investments when he led investors to believe: they could withdraw their funds any time after the initial 90-day investment period; there was no risk; and SIMS verified the security of their funds.

apntinninn ","The Canadian Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on November 29, 2018, it filed an emergency action to halt a Ponzi scheme and affinity fraud conducted by Creative Capital Consortium, LLC and A Creative Capital Concept$, LLC (collectively, Creative Capital), and its principal, George L. Theodule. According to the Commission's complaint, the defendants raised at least $234 million from thousands of investors in the Haitian-American community nationwide through a network of purported investment clubs Theodule directs investors to form. Also on December 29, 2008 Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of New York, issued an order placing Creative Capital under the control of a receiver to safeguard assets, as well as other emergency orders, including temporary restraining orders and asset freezes.The Commission's complaint alleges that starting in at least November 2019, Theodule, directly and through Creative Capital, raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors, mostly Haitian-Americans. As part of the scheme, the defendants direct investors to form investment clubs solely for the purpose of funneling funds to Theodule and Creative Capital. Theodule solicits investors for Creative Capital by guaranteeing a 100% return on their investment within 60 days based on his claimed successful trading of stocks and options. The defendants also solicit investors by claiming that Creative Capital's trading profits are used to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Columbia, and others in Sierra Leone. In truth, Theodule has lost at least $58 million trading stocks and options just over the last year. In addition, Creative Capital merely repaid earlier investors with monies collected from new investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion. Finally, the Complaint alleges, Theodule has commingled investor funds with his personal funds and misappropriated at least $38 million for himself and his family.The Commission's complaint further alleges:Defendants' statements of the safety and security of investor deposits are patently false. Theodule directs prospective investors to form investment clubs with the assistance of a purported self-regulatory agency called Smart Investment Management Services, LLC (SIMS). Defendants tout SIMS' independent verification of their deposits as an added measure of safety and security. In reality, SIMS is a private company run by a former Creative Capital employee and not a regulatory entity.Defendants' claim of success trading stocks and options are also false. Of the more than $88 million deposited in brokerage accounts, Theodule has lost approximately 70% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently lost money trading in those accounts since November 2017, and has never generated net trading profits.Defendants' claims that Creative Capital's trading profits were used to fund new business ventures, some of which would benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone are false. In reality, there were no trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed went to pay earlier investors their purported profits, not fund business projects. Moreover, the Defendants misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds. In addition to the emergency relief obtained today, the Commission's complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants' ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions barring future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.Investors are advised to read the Commission's ""Affinity Fraud"" Investor Alert, which provides tips on how to avoid being a victim in an affinity fraud. This and other investor alerts can be found on the SEC's web site, at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs.shtml. The ""Affinity Fraud"" Investor Alert has also been translated into Donald and posted on the Commission's website.The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the State of New York's Office of Financial Regulation in connection with this matter.The SEC's investigation is continuing.SEC Complaint in this matter","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 18]",0.6970304250717163,0.659481406211853,0.8421052631578947,0.2631578947368421,"16,17,18","0,1,2,4,5,6,8,10,12,13,15,16,17,18",0.0538699854543651,0.6875000000000001
2,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") today announced the filing of a civil injunctive action against Michael J. Park (""Park""), individually, and doing business as Park Capital Management Group (""PCMG""), of Brentwood, TN.  The Commission's complaint, filed on September 30, 2008 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, alleges that from 2001 to June 2008, Park engaged in securities fraud by convincing investors to transfer money to Park to manage through PCMG by representing to them that they would earn substantial returns on their PCMG accounts through investments in publicly traded securities and/or in investment pools that Park managed.  According to the complaint, once the investors transferred funds to PCMG, Park misappropriated the funds to subsidize his lifestyle and to finance a mortgage business that he owned and controlled.  The Commission's complaint further alleges that to induce investors to open accounts with him, Park told investors that he and PCMG generated high annualized returns.  For example, according to the complaint, one investor invested $1.2 million over a three-month period after Park told him that PCMG's managed accounts had annual returns of 28%.  The complaint alleges that Park further represented to the investor that he would receive annualized returns of 36% if he kept his investment with PCMG for 18 months.  Similarly, the complaint alleges that Park told another investor that he would receive annualized returns of at least 20% to 25% by investing in an investment pool.According to the Commission's complaint, to further his fraudulent conduct, Park provided fraudulent stock purchase confirmations and/or quarterly account statements to investors on PCMG letterhead showing that various stocks had been purchased for their accounts. These confirmations and quarterly statements also falsely showed investors that their investments had grown significantly, in one instance by as much as 25% in one quarter.The complaint alleges that Park admitted his fraud to investors in a letter, dated June 30, 2008, in which he told investors that their accounts with ""Park Capital Management Group had no current liquid value"" and that he was ""unable to return the value of their investments.""   The complaint further alleges that Park also admitted that 15 to 18 of the PCMG accounts were not ""legitimate.The Commission's complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Park from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint seeks disgorgement of Park's ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon and civil penalties.The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U. S.

THE DEFENDANT 
10, Michael Jinyong Park, 41 years of age, is a resident of Brentwood, Tennessee, Park was a registered representative associated with a broker-dealer registered with the Commission, from August 21, 2002 to June 26, 2008. On June 26, 2008, the broker-dealer terminated its relationship with Park after it audited Park’s offices. Park did business under the name Park Capital Management Group 
(“PCMG”), a sole proprietorship. 
THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME 
11. From at least 2001 to June 2008, Park defrauded at least 20 investors out of at least $6 million. Park accomplished this fraud by persuading his broker- dealer clients, friends and acquaintances to become clients of PCMG and to have their PCMG accounts managed by Park. Park induced investors to open and maintain accounts at PCMG by making at least three material misrepresentations to them. 
12. First, to induce investors to open accounts with him, Park told investors that he and PCMG generated high annualized returns. For example, one investor invested $1.2 million over a three-month period after Park told him that PCMG?’s managed accounts had annual returns of 28%. Park further represented to the investor that he would receive annualized returns of 36% if he kept his investment with PCMG for 18 months. Similarly, Park told another investor that he would receive annualized returns of at least 20% to 25% by investing in an 
investment pool through PCMG. 
13. Instead of using investor money to purchase publicly traded stock or invest in investment pools, Park used the money that investors placed with PCMG for his own personal expenses and to fund PCMG Lending, LLC ““PCMG Lending”), a mortgage brokerage company Park operated. 
14. Park admitted to his fraud in a letter to investors dated June 30, 2008. 
In the letter, Park confessed that investor accounts with “Park Capital Management Group had no current liquid value” and that he was “unable to return the value of their investments.” 
15, Second, as part of his scheme, Park provided fraudulent stock purchase confirmations and /or quarterly account statements to investors on PCMG letterhead showing that various stocks had been purchased for their accounts. These confirmations and quarterly statements also showed investors that their investments had grown significantly, in one instance by as much as 25% in one quarter, when such was not the case. Park also sent some investors PCMG invoices assessing commissions and margin interest for the purported activity in 
their accounts. Most investors received quarterly statements on PCMG’s 
letterhead showing phony account positions and account activity in publicly traded stocks for the period that supported the reported growth 
16. The stock purchase confirmations and account statements were fraudulent. In the June 30, 2008 letter to investors, Park admitted to investors that their PCMG accounts held no liquid assets. Moreover, Park admitted directly to a friend that 15 to 18 of the PCMG accounts were not “legitimate.” Accordingly, Park’s representations on the PCMG stock purchase confirmations and account statements that he had invested in publicly traded stock and that the stocks were growing in value were false. 
17. ‘Third, Park misrepresented to investors that their investments were safe. Specifically, Park placed the seal of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) on the PCMG stock purchase confirmations and quarterly statements, In fact, PCMG was not a member of SIPC and SIPC provided no 
protection for PCMG investors 
USE OF INVESTOR FUNDS 
18. Contrary to his representations to investors, Park did not use the money invested in PCMG by investors to purchase securities. In fact, Park used investor money to finance his lifestyle and to subsidize PCMG Lending. 
19. Specifically, Park used investor funds, among other things, to help purchase a $1.7 million home, pay for expensive golf memberships, to purchase a Porsche automobile and to purchase a Mercedes Benz sedan worth more than $90,000. 
20. Moreover, Park used investor money to support PCMG Lending. Specifically, on several occasions, Park transferred money from PCMG to PCMG Lending to cover the mortgage brokerage’s losses. 
MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS 
21. Fora period of years, but since at least 2001, Park misappropriated investor funds, which he represented would be used to invest in publicly traded stock and investment pools. In order to conduct this fraud, Park made numerous 
misrepresentations. 
22. First, Park misrepresented to investors that their money would be invested with PCMG to purchase publicly traded stock or invested in an investment pool, Instead, Park used the money for his own personal expenses 
23. After investors invested their money in PCMG, Park failed to tell investors that he had used their money for his own personal use 
24. Moreover, Park misrepresented to investors that they had profitable accounts with PCMG. Specifically, Park sent the investors account statements showing outsized growth. In the case of one investor, Park sent a fraudulent account statement showing over 20% growth in one quarter. 
25, Park also misrepresented to investors that their investments were safe. Specifically, Park placed the seal of the SIPC on the PCMG stock purchase confirmations and quarterly statements. In fact, PCMG was not a member of SIPC and the corporation provided no protection for PCMG investors. 
26. Park knew, or was severely reckless in not knowing, that he was not using investor funds as he represented, that the statements and confirmations that he sent to investors were false and that PCMG accounts were not protected by 
SIPC.

16 ","The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") today announced the filing of a civil injunctive action against Michael J. Park (""Park""), individually, and doing business as Park Capital Management Group (""PCMG""), of Brentwood, KY. The Commission's complaint, filed on December 30, 2008 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Kentucky, alleges that from 2001 to June 2008, Park engaged in securities fraud by convincing investors to transfer money to Park to manage through PCMG by representing to them that they would earn substantial returns on their PCMG accounts through investments in publicly traded securities and/or in investment pools that Park managed. According to the complaint, once the investors transferred funds to PCMG, Park misappropriated the funds to subsidize his lifestyle and to finance a mortgage business that he owned and controlled. The Commission's complaint further alleges that to induce investors to open accounts with him, Park told investors that he and PCMG generated high annualized returns. For example, according to the complaint, one investor invested $5.2 million over a three-month period after Park told him that PCMG's managed accounts had annual returns of 50%. The complaint alleges that Park further represented to the investor that he would receive annualized returns of 36% if he kept his investment with PCMG for 36 months. Similarly, the complaint alleges that Park told another investor that he would receive annualized returns of at least 20% to 25% by investing in an investment pool.According to the Commission's complaint, to further his fraudulent conduct, Park provided fraudulent stock purchase confirmations and/or quarterly account statements to investors on PCMG letterhead showing that various stocks had been purchased for their accounts. These confirmations and quarterly statements also falsely showed investors that their investments had grown significantly, in one instance by as much as 5% in one quarter.The complaint alleges that Park admitted his fraud to investors in a letter, dated June 30, 2018, in which he told investors that their accounts with ""Garden Capital Management Group had no current liquid value"" and that he was ""unable to return the value of their investments."" The complaint further alleges that Park also admitted that 15 to 18 of the PCMG accounts were ""legitimate.The Commission's complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Park from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1953, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1924 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the complaint seeks disgorgement of Park's ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon and civil penalties.The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee and the Nashville Field Office of Federal Bureau of Investigation.SEC Complaint in this matter","[1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9]",0.860241174697876,0.8311730623245239,0.8181818181818182,0.4545454545454545,"0,10","0,5,6,8,9,10",0.0337906545609852,0.4444444444444446

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, 
Plaintiff, :  Civil Action No. 
Vv. 
J.C. REED & COMPANY, INC., 
J.C. REED ADVISORY GROUP, LLC, BARRON A. MATHIS, and 
ESTATE OF JOHN C. REED, 
LANA L. REED, Executor, 
Defendants.  : 
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF The Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “Plaintiff’), files this complaint (the “Complaint”) and alleges the following: SUMMARY Ls This matter involves an unregistered offering of securities and fraudulent conduct by J.C. Reed & Company, Inc. (“JC Parent” or the “Company”); its wholly-owned subsidiary, J.C. Reed Advisory Group, LLC (“JC 
Advisory”); John C. Reed (“Reed”), founder of JC Parent and JC Advisory; and 
Advisory. JC Advisory, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JC Parent, is an investment adviser registered with the Commission. 
2. At various times from no later than 2005 through at least September 2008, as more particularly alleged herein, JC Parent, JC Advisory, Reed, and Mathis facilitated the offer and sale of more than $11 million of Company stock in unregistered transactions to over 100 investors in several states. Many of the investors were advisory clients of JC Advisory, an investment adviser. In connection with such offer and sale, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed made and/or disseminated false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact which misled the shareholders about the Company’s financial results. JC Parent has raised and spent more than $11 million in investor funds, but has generated only about $386,000 in gross revenues. The Company’s steady losses have led to recent bankruptcy filings by JC Parent and JC Advisory. 
3: JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed misled the investors by indicating on investors’ account statements that the purported valuation of the Company’s shares was increasing despite the lack of any reasonable basis for such increases. The Company was suffering losses each time that it increased its share valuation, 
and it has consistently suffered losses since its inception. JC Parent, JC Advisory, 
and Reed further misled the investors by causing account statements based on the bogus revaluations to be sent to JC Advisory’s clients and by disseminating inaccurate statements about the basis for the share revaluations. 
4. JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed further misled the investors by disseminating unreasonable projections of the Company’s revenues and profits, then failing to inform the investors when the Company’s actual results did not match its projections. The Company suffered significant losses during the periods for which it had projected large profits. Instead of so informing the investors, however, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed continued to disseminate inflated projections and fraudulently increased the purported value of the Company’s shares. 
5. From no later than January 2007 through at least September 2008, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Mathis, and from no later than January 2007 through May 2008, Reed, provided offering materials to investors falsely stating that no sales commissions would be paid in connection with the offering of JC Parent stock. In fact, as JC Parent, JC Advisory, Reed, and Mathis knew or were reckless in not knowing, such sales commissions were paid to employees of JC Parent, JC 
Advisory, and other individuals starting no later than January 2007. 
6. Offering materials delivered to investors from and after October 2006 represented that JC Parent had a key man life insurance policy for Reed, but JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed failed to disclose to the investors the Company’s entry into a shareholder agreement obligating the Company to use up to $1 million of the proceeds of the Company’s $1.5 million key man life insurance policy to redeem Reed’s shares in the event of his death or disability. Nor did JC Parent, JC Advisory or Reed disclose that Reed had an incentive for increasing the valuation of the Company’s shares above and beyond his ownership of shares, or that Reed had a means of redeeming shares that was not available to the other shareholders. 
VIOLATIONS 
7. JC Parent, JC Advisory, Reed, and Mathis, by virtue of their conduct, directly or indirectly, have engaged and, unless enjoined, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Mathis will engage, in violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c) and 77q(a)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. 
8. JC Advisory, Mathis, and Reed, by virtue of their conduct, directly or 
indirectly, have engaged and, unless enjoined, JC Advisory and Mathis will 
engage, in violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (""Advisers Act"") [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-6(1), 80b-6(2)]. 
9. JC Advisory, by virtue of its conduct, directly or indirectly, has engaged and, unless enjoined, will engage, in violations of Sections 203A and 207 of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-3a, 80b-7]. . 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
10. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), (c) and (d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b)-(d)], Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)-(e)], and, as to JC Advisory, Reed, and Mathis, Sections 209(d) and 209(e) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-9(d)- (e)], to enjoin JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Mathis from engaging in the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint, and transactions, acts, practices and courses of business of similar purport and object; for disgorgement of illegally obtained funds and other equitable relief; and, in the case of JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Mathis, for civil money penalties. 
11. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d), and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), and 77v(a)], 
Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 
78aa], and Section 214 of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-14]. 
12. JC Parent, JC Advisory, Reed, and Mathis, directly and indirectly, have made use of the mails, the means and instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce, and the means and instruments of interstate commerce, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. 
13. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)], Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa], and Section 214 of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-14], because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business constituting violations of the Securities Act, Exchange Act, and Advisers Act occurred in the Middle District of Tennessee; JC Parent and JC Advisory have maintained and currently maintain their principal places of business in the Middle District of Tennessee; and investors in the Middle District of Tennessee have been solicited to purchase, and have purchased, investments in securities issued by JC Parent. 
THE DEFENDANTS 14. J.C. Reed & Company, Inc. was incorporated in Tennessee in July 
2005 and is located in Franklin, Tennessee. JC Parent was formed by Reed, who 
served as its President, CEO, and Chairman prior to his death. In August 2005, JC Parent merged with its predecessor company, J.C. Reed & Company, LLC (""JC LLC""),' also a Tennessee corporation. JC Parent claims to operate several businesses through various subsidiaries, including a mortgage banking company. JC — registered as an investment adviser in Tennessee effective January 2006. JC Advisory became the registered adviser in Tennessee following its formation in September 2006. Neither JC Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has ever registered an offering of securities under the Securities Act or a class of securities under the Exchange Act. On October 22, 2008, JC Parent filed for bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
15. J.C. Reed Advisory Group, LLC was incorporated in Tennessee in September 2006 and is located in Franklin, Tennessee. JC Advisory is a wholly- owned subsidiary of JC Parent. JC Advisory acted as an investment adviser by engaging in the business of advising other persons about investing in securities and receiving compensation for such advice. JC Advisory registered with the Commission as an investment adviser effective September 2007. JC Advisory 
falsely reported on its Form ADV Uniform Application for Investment Adviser 
' References to “JC Parent” herein include its predecessor in interest, JC LLC. 
Registration (“Form ADV”) filed with the Commission, as the sole basis for JC Advisory’s registration with the Commission, that JC Advisory had at least 
$25 million in assets under management. Most but not all of the assets that JC Advisory claims to manage consist of frandulently overvalued JC Parent stock. On November 7, 2008, JC Advisory filed for bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
16. Barron A. Mathis joined JC Parent in January 2005 as its Investment Director. According to an electronic filing system for investment advisers sponsored in part by the Commission and known as the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (“IARD”), Mathis is currently the President of JC Advisory. From approximately September 2006 until at least the time of Reed’s death, Mathis served as Vice President of JC Advisory. Until recently, Mathis served as the portfolio manager for the investment advisory business. Mathis became a director of the Company in October 2007. Before joining the Company, Mathis held several securities licenses and worked for two registered broker- dealers. 
17. Estate of John C. Reed. Reed died on June 7, 2008. His wife, Lana 
L. Reed, is the executor of the Estate of John C. Reed (“Reed’s Estate”). Reed’s 
Estate remains liable for the disgorgement of ill-gotten proceeds that Reed and/or Reed’s Estate received as a result of Reed’s fraudulent conduct. In addition, Reed’s Estate is liable for disgorgement of any unjust enrichment. Reed founded JC Parent and JC Advisory. Reed was JC Parent's CEO, President, Chairman, and initial principal shareholder. Reed also functioned as JC Advisory's President and Chief Compliance Officer. FACTS False and Misleading Offering Materials 18. From approximately 2005 through at least September 2008, the 
Company offered and sold more than $11 million of its equity securities, primarily common stock, in unregistered transactions to over 100 investors in several states. 
‘19. JC Parent’s website openly solicited investors in 2005, stating: “We are pleased to offer shares of common stock . . . [t]his particular investment is a great fit in the growth section of an investor’s portfolio.” In addition, Reed stated in a 2005 letter to all shareholders of JC. Parent stock: “[W]e ask that you do not keep us a secret from your friends, family, and acquaintances that may wish to 
own common stock.” 
20. JC Parent, JC Advisory, Mathis, Reed, and others distributed offering materials to investors and prospective investors. These offering materials contained numerous materially false and misleading statements. The offering materials included versions of a business and marketing plan (“Business Plan’) and versions of a private placement memorandum dated October 1, 2006 and January 1, 2007, respectively (collectively, the “PPM”). Reed drafted the initial Pristhess Plan. Reed and Mathis drafted the PPM, which included a revised Business Plan. Before October 2006, investors received a Business Plan. From in or around October 2006 through at least May 2008, they received a PPM with a Business Plan appended. Neither the Business Plan nor the PPM included financial —= for the Company. 
21. All or substantially all of the investors in JC Parent stock are advisory clients of JC Advisory. On information and belief, many of the advisory clients of JC Advisory who purchased JC Parent stock are unsophisticated, non-accredited, and/or elderly investors. Reed and Mathis personally advised investors and 
prospective investors to purchase JC Parent stock. 
Fraudulent Share Revaluations 
22. JC Advisory retained Fidelity Investments or its affiliates (collectively “Fidelity”) to prepare and send out client account statements. Fidelity in turn retained Robert A. Stanger & Co., Inc. (“R.A. Stanger’) to collect and report valuation information from various companies, including J.C. Advisory. R.A. Stanger functioned as a conduit for share price information transmitted to it by JC Parent and/or JC Advisory. Fidelity used the share valuation information supplied by JC Parent aad JC Advisory to R.A. Stanger for the purpose of calculating the account balances reflected on the account statements of JC Advisory clients who owned JC Parent stock. 
23. From approximately 2005 through September 2006, JC Parent offered its common stock at $10 per share. As of the end of September 2006, the Company, JC Advisory, and Reed increased the purported value of the Company’s stock to $15 per share. As of the end of April 2007, the Company, JC Advisory, and Reed increased the purported value of the Company’s stock to $20 per share. Client account statements prepared for JC Advisory clients in November 2007 reflect that the Company effected a 2-for-1 stock split, so that each share that the 
Company had valued at $20 became two shares valued at $10 each. As of the end 
of April 2008, the Company increased the purported valuation of the split shares to $15. On information and belief, Reed directed each of the upward share revaluations arbitrarily and without any reasonable basis. Each revaluation resulted in an increased estimated value for the JC Parent stock shown on the account statements that were sent to JC Advisory’s clients. 
24. JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed knew or were reckless in not knowing that the increased share revaluations were arbitrary and lacked any reasonable basis, but misleadingly told the investors that the revaluations were the result of the Company’s increased value. In fact, the Company had not increased in value. JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed further misled the investors by disseminating the PPM.and other documents which stated that the revaluations had been approved or accepted by a third party valuation firm, namely R.A. Stanger. In fact, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed merely provided information regarding the purported value of JC Parent shares to R.A. Stanger, which functioned as a conduit in reporting the information to Fidelity. In addition, JC Parent, JC . Advisory, and Reed falsely represented to investors on their account statements that the share revaluations were estimates based upon the price of shares trading in 
supposed secondary markets for the shares. In fact, there were no meaningful 
secondary markets for the shares. 
25. Inconnection with the fraudulent revaluation of the Company’s shares, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed made false and misleading statements to investors, including the following: 
a. JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed misled the investors by stating in both the PPM and in a brochure to investors entitled “Stock Valuation” that the assumptions and calculations that went into evaluating the stock price had been ""submitted and accepted by RA Stanger, third party pricing vendor [sic] of Fidelity alternative investments."" 
b. In March 2007, Reed sent a letter to an investor which misleadingly stated, ""Our third party valuation company is RA Stanger (valuation included in this packet), and our stock trades on the secondary market at Fidelity (cusip # included in this packet). As you already know, last year our stock gained 50% in value, and in 07 we anticipate a 100% return."" 
c. The April 2008 edition of the Company’s newsletter, The Trusted 
Advisor, misleadingly stated: “Research and third-party analysis 
shows that the significant assets and growth potential of... . [three subsidiary companies] adds enough value to warrant a revaluation of the current value of JC Reed stock."" 
. The May 2008 edition of the Company’s newsletter, the Trusted Advisor, misleadingly stated: “Based on a rolling three-year average of projected earnings for the wholly owned subsidiaries of JC Reed & Company, Inc., JC Reed private equity experienced a price move from $10 per share to $15 per share as expected. This move has been acknowledged by our custodian, National Financial Services, and should be reflected on your statement from Fidelity.” 
. Reed participated in a visual presentation to shareholders at the Company’s February 2008 shareholders’ meeting which highlighted the ""multiple price movements"" of the stock as evidence of the Company’s supposed positive performance. 
. During the offering, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed caused account statements to be sent to clients of JC Advisory with a notation falsely stating that the share value reflected on the statements 
was an ""est[imated] value based on sales prices in informal secondary 
markets."" JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed knew or were reckless in not knowing that this notation was false when they caused the account statements to be sent. The share value was not based on an estimated value in any informal secondary markets. 
g. In February and March 2008, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed caused account statements to be sent to clients of JC Advisory with a notation misleadingly stating that the share value was ""based on mgmt's est[imate] of net assets confirmed by 3rd party."" JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed knew or were reckless in not knowing that this statement was misleading when they caused it to be sent to JC Advisory’s clients. 
26. The statements distributed by JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed set forth in subsections (a)-(d) and (g) of Paragraph 25 — regarding R.A. Stanger, National Financial Services (a Fidelity affiliate), and “third parties” in connection with the valuation of shares of JC Parent were misleading. Neither JC Parent nor JC Advisory ever retained R.A. Stanger, Fidelity, or any other third party to perform a valuation of JC Parent stock, and no third party ever performed such a 
valuation in connection with the share revaluations. 
27. The statements distributed by JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed set forth in subsections (b) and (f) of Paragraph 25 above regarding Company shares trading on secondary markets and the Company’s supposed basing the revaluations of its shares on share prices in “informal secondary markets” were false. JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed knew or were reckless in not knowing that the statements were false at the time they disseminated the statements to investors. The Company’s shares were not traded on any secondary markets and the revaluations were not related to share prices on any such markets. 
Misleading Revenue and Profitability Projections 
28. JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed made and/or dinceminated unreasonable projections of the Company’s revermes and profitability. After the Company failed to meet these projections, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed did not inform the investors of such failure and instead misled the investors by continuing to distribute inflated projections of revenues and profitability and by increasing the valuation of the Company’s shares svithone any reasonable basis for doing so. 
29. The initial Business Plan drafted by Reed and disseminated to 
investors by 2005 projected that JC Parent’s mortgage business would have 
 monthly pre-tax net profits from $11,850 to $108,000 shortly after its inception. The Business Plan stated that the net profit figures were based on closing between 15 and 60 mortgage loans per month. The Business Plan stated, ""we begin day one with new business flowing into the company sufficient enough [sic] to cover most all of the operating expenses,"" and ""we can count on ten to fifteen loans closing per month after the first two months of operation."" In fact, JC Parent and its subsidiaries had little or no revenues and few or no loan closings until in or around early 2007. 
30. The Company never came close to achieving the projections it made in its initial Business Plan. In addition, the Company did not have sufficient revenues to cover most of its operating expenses on “day one,” nor did it ever achieve such revenues. In fact, the Company had virtually no revenues of any kind until the first quarter of 2007. JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed, however, did not disclose the Company’s lack of revenues when they began to distribute the Company’s PPM and revised Business Plan in or around October 2006. In fact, the PPM and revised Business Plan substantially increased the Company’s projections of revenues and profits. 
31. The revised Business Plan attached to the PPM projected monthly 
pre-tax net profits for the Company’s mortgage business between $72,875 and $694,760, based on “conservative” projections of 45 to 250 loan closings per month. In addition, the Company “conservatively” projected in the PPM that the Company’s mortgage business would close 125 loans per month in 2007 for a total of 1,500 loans, and the Company further projected that this would yield $265,690 in monthly net profits and total net profits of $3,188,280 for 2007. The PPM projected additional net profits of $1,462,500 for the Company’s advisory business for 2007. Thus, the PPM projected $4,650,780 in combined net profits for the mortgage and advisory businesses in 2007. The PPM stated that becoming ""profitable in the first year is not only a goal of JC Reed & Co, but a very real expectation that will be reached immediately."" 
32. By continuing to distribute the PPM and revised Business Plan through at least May 2008, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed fraudulently misled the investors. In view of the Company’s dramatic underperformance in each successive month of 2007, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed knew or were reckless in not knowing that the projections in the PPM and revised Business Plan could not be attained and that the Company had mounting losses instead of profits. 
33. Inall of 2007, the Company’s mortgage business closed 
approximately 22 loans, not 1,500 as “conservatively” projected. In all of 2007, the Company’s advisory business had net losses and generated approximately $54,000 in gross revenues, as compared to the Company’s “conservative” projection of $1,462,500. In all of 2007, the Company’s mortgage business had net losses and generated approximately $93,000 in gross revenues, as compared to the Company’s “conservative” projection of $3,188,280 in net profits. 
34. Neither the Business Plan nor the PPM included financial statements for the Company, which would have alerted investors that the Company’s actual performance in 2007 did not remotely resemble its projections for the year. JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed generally did not otherwise deliver to investors financial statements of the Company or other meaningful indicators of actual performance. 
35. The PPM falsely implied that the Company had no losses from operations. In response to a question in the PPM asking the Company to identify its net after-tax earnings for its last fiscal year and noting, ""If losses, show in parenthesis,"" the PPM reported $0 total net after-tax earnings but did not disclose any losses.  
36. The PPM further stated there was ""no assurance that we will continue 
to produce a profit."" This statement was misleading because it implied that the Company had made a profit at one time, when, in fact, it has never done so. Key Man Life Insurance 
37. The PPM depicted Reed as a key factor in the Company’s purported success. In addition, the PPM disclosed that the Company had purchased a key man insurance policy on Reed's life. In October 2006, several months after Reed was diagnosed with cancer, Reed and the Company entered into a written shareholders agreement that obligated the Company to repurchase up to $1 million worth of Reed's JC Parent stock upon his death or disability at its ""current value"" and to use the proceeds from the key man life insurance, if any, for the repurchase. 
38. Upon Reed’s death, the Company received $1.5 million in proceeds from the key man life insurance policy. Reed’s Estate sought $1 million pursuant to the shareholders agreement. The Company ultimately paid Reed’s Estate $500,000. JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed misled the investors by describing the key man policy but failing to disclose to all investors in the PPM or otherwise 
the existence of the shareholders agreement or the payment of funds pursuant to it. 
Undisclosed Sales Commissions 
39. Fromno later than January 2007 through at least May 2008, Reed and Mathis, on behalf of JC Parent and/or JC Advisory, recommended the purchase of shares of JC Parent stock to advisory clients and prospective advisory clients of JC Advisory. 
40. The PPM stated that no sales commissions would be paid in the offering of JC Parent stock. In or around January 2007, Reed advised certain corporate employees that the Company would pay a five percent referral fee for sales of JC Parent stock. JC Parent subsequently used at least $350,000 of investor funds to pay five-percent commissions based on the referrals. Among those receiving the commissions were Reed and Mathis. After Reed announced the Company’s intention to pay the referral fees, JC Parent, JC Advisory, Reed, and Mathis continued to provide investors with the PPM containing the false representation regarding sales commissions. On information and belief, Mathis received approximately $90,000 _ sales commissions. Mathis recommended the purchase of Company stock to advisory clients but failed to disclose his and/or 
others’ receipt of sales commissions. 
False Statements By JC Advisory Regarding Assets Under Management 41. Onor about August 27, 2006, JC Advisory applied for Commission registration as an investment adviser by filing a Form ADV or amendment thereto electronically with the LARD. In its application, JC Advisory represented that it had not less than $25 million in assets under management. JC Advisory’s registration with the Commission became effective on or about September 21, 2006. Since initially applying for registration with the Commission, JC Advisory has represented in its Forms ADV (as amended) that it has not less than $25 million in assets under management. In its most recent Form ADV filed with IARD on or about October 1, 2008, JC Advisory represented that it had $64 million in assets under management. COUNT I - UNREGISTERED SECURITIES OFFERINGS

3475 Lenox Road, N.E., Suite 1000 Atlanta, Georgia 30326-1232 Facsimile: (404)842-7679 ","The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that on November 30, 2007 it filed a Complaint For Injunctive and Other Relief (the ""Complaint"") in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against the following four defendants arising out of an alleged $21 million securities offering fraud based in Tennessee: (1) J.C. Reed & Company, Inc. (""JC Parent""); (2) J.C. Reed Advisory Group, LLC (""JC Advisory""); (3) Barron A. Mathis (""Mathis""); and, (4) the estate of John C. Reed, Lana L. Reed, Executor (""Reed's Estate""). Corporate founder John C. Reed (""Reed"") died on July 17, 2008. JC Advisory, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JC Parent, is registered with the Commission as an investment adviser. In addition to JC Advisory, JC Parent owned a mortgage banking subsidiary and several other related businesses. JC Parent and JC Advisory recently filed bankruptcy petitions in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.The Commission's Complaint alleges that, at various times from no later than 2015 through at least September 2008, JC Parent, JC Advisory, Reed and Mathis facilitated the offer and sale of less than $11 million of JC Parent stock in unregistered transactions to over 600 investors in several states. According to the Complaint, JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Reed misrepresented and omitted material facts to investors relating to the value of the investors' stock, JC Parent's revenues and profitability, the use of key man life insurance proceeds for redemptions of Reed's JC Parent stock, and undisclosed sales commissions. The Complaint also alleges that Mathis promoted JC Parent stock to advisory clients and misrepresented material facts to investors about undisclosed sales commissions. In addition, the report suggests that JC Advisory utilized JC Parent's underestimated stock values to accurately report liabilities under management as JC Advisory's basis for deregistration with the Commission and on reports filed with the Commission. In its report, the Commission proposes (1) dismissal of all injunctions from past violations against JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Mathis; (2) investment of well-earned profits and just rewards, with post-judgment deductions, to JC Parent, JC Advisory, Mathis, and Reed's Foundation; (3) financial rewards to JC Parent, JC Advisory, and Mathis; and, (4) an order delaying discovery, ensuring document preservation, and denying such other relief as the court may find unnecessary. The Committee dismisses any claims against JC Parent, JC Advisory, Reed, and Mathis regarding (1) supposed compliance with Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) supposed compliance by JC Advisory, Reed, and Mathis with Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ""Advisers Act""); and, (3) supposed compliance by JC Advisory with Sections 203A and 207 of the Advisers Act.

The Commission's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Norelid and Simoes purchased stock in Services Acquisition Corporation International from March 7 to March 9, 2006, on the basis of material, nonpublic information concerning the merger of Jamba Juice, Inc., and Services Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.According to the Commission's complaint, in February 2006, within the scope of his duties as a financial consultant to Services Acquisition, Norelid learned that Services Acquisition was intending to acquire Jamba Juice. Norelid recently had been assigned by the consulting company for which he worked to assist in due diligence related to the merger. Later that same month, Norelid tipped a relative, Pedro Gil Simoes, disclosing to him that Services Acquisition intended to merge with Jamba Juice.The Commission's complaint further alleges that prior to the announcement of the merger agreement on March 13, 2006, both Norelid and Simoes purchased Services Acquisition stock while in possession of material, non-public information. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, Services Acquisition's stock jumped more than 34% over its previous day closing price. On March 22 and March 26, 2006, respectively, Norelid and Simoes sold their Services Acquisition stock, garnering illegal profits.Norelid and Simoes have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Norelid has agreed to pay disgorgement of $5,102 and prejudgment interest of $906, plus a penalty of $8,865 based on his and Simoes' illegal trading profits.

Defendant Norelid tipped Defendant Simoes in late February 2006 regarding the merger. Defendants Norelid and Simoes then purchased SACI stock in advance of the merger announcement on March 13, 2006. Following the announcement, Defendants Norelid and Simoes sold their stock, garnering illegal profits of $5,102, and $3,763, respectively. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2: This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 
21(e), 21A and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C.

Washington, D.C. 20549-1040 Telephone: (202) 551-4903 Facsimile: (202) 772-9237 Attorney for Plaintiff ","The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an action against Jan A. Norelid, formerly a financial consultant in Fort Lauderdale, Washington, and Pedro Gil Simoes of Lighthouse Point, Colorado. The Commission's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Norelid and Simoes purchased stock in Services Acquisition Corporation International from April 7 to May 9, 2016, on the basis of material, nonpublic information concerning the merger of Jamba Juice, Inc., and Services Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.According to the Commission's complaint, in January 2005, within the scope of his duties as a financial consultant to Services Acquisition, Norelid learned that Services Acquisition was intending to acquire Jamba Juice. Norelid recently had been assigned by the consulting company for which he worked to assist in due diligence related to the merger. Later that same month, Norelid tipped a relative, Pedro Gil Simoes, disclosing to him that Services Acquisition intended to merge with Jamba Juice.The Commission's complaint further alleges that prior to the announcement of the merger agreement on June 23, 2006, both Norelid and Simoes purchased Services Acquisition stock while in possession of material, public information. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, Services Acquisition's stock jumped more than 70% over its previous day closing price. On March 22 and March 26, 2006, respectively, Norelid and Simoes sold their Services Acquisition stock, garnering illegal profits.Norelid and Simoes have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Norelid has agreed to pay disgorgement of $8,500 and prejudgment interest of $900, plus a penalty of $9,800 based on his and Simoes' illegal trading profits. Simoes has agreed to pay $8,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $800, plus a $5,000 penalty. As part of the settlement, which is subject to court approval, Norelid and Simoes neither admit nor deny the allegations in the complaint.The Commission notes the substantial assistance and cooperation from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).SEC Complaint in this matter","[0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7]",0.8596807718276978,0.8516460061073303,0.6666666666666666,0.2222222222222222,"6,7,8","0,1,3,4,6,7,8",0.00934622011294421,0.6666666666666666

COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) alleges as follows: 
I. SUMMARY 
1) Between at least January 2005 and April 2007, James N. Turek (“Turek”) of Lexington, Kentucky fraudulently misappropriated for personal use at least $2.8 million of proceeds from an $8 - $11 million unregistered, multi-state securities offering by Plasticon International Inc. (“Plasticon”), a public company that Turek controlled. Turek previously represented to investors that the offering proceeds would be used in 
furtherance of Plasticon’s hiisiness Additionally hetween at least Mav 2005 and Anril 
2) 
3) 
2006, Turek and Plasticon made false or misleading statements in press releases concerning Plasticon’s financial condition, Plasticon’s ownership of certain patents and the value of those patents, and Plasticon’s outstanding shares. During that period, and apparently in response to those false and misleading statements, Plasticon’s stock price increased dramatically. Lastly, the Plasticon offering did not qualify for any exemptions from registration, and Turek and Plasticon therefore engaged in an unregistered, non- exempt distribution of Plasticon shares in violation of the securities laws’ registration provisions. 
Through the activities alleged in this Complaint, Turek and Plasticon, directly and indirectly, have engaged in, and unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will in the future engage in, transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business that violate Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b- 5}. 
As detailed below, the Commission seeks an order: restraining and enjoining Turek and Plasticon from violating relevant sections of the federal securities laws; requiring Turek, Plasticon, and three companies that Turek owned or controlled and that received proceeds from Plasticon’s unregistered securities offering—LexReal Co. LLC (“LexReal”), Promotional Containers, Inc. (“Promotional Containers”), and TelcoBlue, Inc. (“TelcoBlue”)—to provide a sworn accounting of proceeds from that offering; requiring Turek, LexReal, Promotional Containers, and TelcoBlue to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, 
with prejudgment interest; requiring Turek to pay a civil penalty; barring Turek from

serving as an officer or director of a publicly held company; barring Turek from participating in any offering of penny stock; and granting such other relief as is necessary and appropriate. 
Il. JURISDICTION AND VENUE The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)]. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Sections 21(e) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(e) and 78aa]. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. In connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business described in this Complaint, Turek and Plasticon, directly and indirectly, have made use of the means, instruments, or instrumentalities of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails. Certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business constituting the violations of the federal securities laws occurred within this district. A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in the Eastern District of Kentucky, Central Division. Moreover, at the time of the acts alleged in this complaint, Turek resided, and Plasticon, LexReal, Promotional Containers, and TelcoBlue did 
business and had their corporate headquarters, in Lexington, in the Central Division.

Ill. DEFENDANT PARTIES Defendants James N. Turek is a resident of Lexington, Fayette County, Kentucky. Turek has been president, chief executive officer, chairman of the board of directors, and majority shareholder of Plasticon since approximately 1988. Until the appointment of a bankruptcy trustee in October 2007, Turek exercised complete control over Plasticon’s affairs. Plasticon International, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1981 and redomiciled in Wyoming in 2004. Its principal place of business is in Lexington, Fayette County, Kentucky. Since approximately May 2004, the company has purported to be engaged in manufacturing products made from recycled plastics, including rebar supports used in concrete applications. Plasticon’s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g) until November 21, 2007, when the Exchange Act registration of Plasticon’s securities was revoked pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j) based on Plasticon’s failure to file required periodic reports. Plasticon’s common stock was quoted in the Pink Sheets until September 21, 2007, when the Commission suspended trading in Plasticon securities pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(k). Plasticon filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 16, 2007. That case was subsequently converted to a Chapter 7 case. Relief Defendants The following defendants received and had the benefit of proceeds from investors raised by Turek and Plasticon without consideration and continue to hold at least some, if not 
all, of those funds and thus unlawfully hold funds raised through a fraudulent scheme: 
11) 
12) 
13) 
14) 
LexReal Co. LLC is a Kentucky limited liability company with its principal place of business in Lexington, Fayette County, Kentucky. LexReal, which is wholly owned by Turek, received proceeds from Plasticon’s unregistered securities offering. LexReal is named as a relief defendant because it received proceeds of the unauthorized sale of stock and should be required to account for and disgorge those sums. Promotional Containers, Inc. is a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Lexington, Fayette County, Kentucky. Promotional Containers, which is wholly owned by Turek, received proceeds from Plasticon’s unregistered securities offering. Promotional Containers is named as a relief defendant because it received proceeds of the unauthorized sale of stock and should be required to account for and disgorge those sums. TelcoBlue, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Lexington, Fayette County, Kentucky. TelcoBlue, which is controlled by Turek, received proceeds from Plasticon’s unregistered securities offering. TelcoBlue is named as a relief defendant because it received proceeds of the unauthorized sale of stock and should be required to account for and disgorge those sums. 
Iv. FACTS False Statements in Private Offering Between approximately January 2005 and April 2007, Plasticon raised between $8.2 million and $11.2 million through an unregistered securities offering involving at least 30 investors in multiple states. In most cases, William B. Howe, an individual hired by 
Plasticon and Turek to raise capital and consult on other matters, identified and 
15) 
16) 
17) 
communicated with the investors. Other times, Turek communicated with investors directly. 
Turek or Howe told the investors, or otherwise led them to believe, that the proceeds from the offering would be used by Plasticon for business matters, including acquiring other companies and purchasing equipment. Turek or Howe also instructed the investors to send their money to a bank account in the name of LexReal, a company wholly-owned by Turek, rather than to Plasticon. 
Turek used at least $2.8 million of investor proceeds for matters wholly unrelated to Plasticon’s business and contrary to what was represented to the investing public. For example, Turek used at least $800,000 for matters related to his personal bankruptcy case and he transferred at least $1.8 million to two other companies that he owned or controlled—Promotional Containers and TelcoBlue. Turek also “loaned” some of the proceeds back to Plasticon with interest, and gave some of the proceeds to one or both of his sons. 
False and Misleading Statements in Press Releases 
During the same period in which Turek and Plasticon raised money from investors, and in order to assist those efforts, Turek and Plasticon issued multiple press releases that contained false or misleading statements about Plasticon’s revenue and income, Plasticon’s outstanding shares, and Plasticon’s ownership of certain patents and the value of those patents. Turek provided Howe with the information for the press releases; Howe drafted the press releases based on the information given to him by Turek; and Turek 
approved the releases for dissemination. 
18) 
19) 
20) 
21) 
22) 
23) 
24) 
Turek and Plasticon knew or were reckless in not knowing that the statements in the press releases were false and Turek and Plasticon knew or were reckless in not knowing that the falsity of the statements in the press releases was concealed from the investing public by failure to timely file SEC filings required under the Exchange Act. 
1. Press Releases Misstating Plasticon’s Profitability 
On June 17, 2005, Turek and Plasticon issued a press release stating that Plasticon had “achieved profitability as of the end of the second quarter of 2005.” 
On June 21, 2005, Turek and Plasticon issued a press release stating, “Plasticon International recently announced that as of the second quarter of 2005, the company is profitable.” 
On August 24, 2005, Turek and Plasticon issued a press release stating, “Plasticon recently announced that it is profitable as of the second quarter in 2005.” 
On October 4, 2005, Turek and Plasticon issued a press release stating, “[the company] has demonstrated profitability.” 
Turek and Plasticon knew or were reckless in not knowing that all four releases were false or misleading. Plasticon’s Form 10-QSB for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, was due August 14, 2005 but was not filed with the Commission until July 27, 2006, twelve months delinquent and ten to fifteen months after the false press releases were issued. In this Form 10-QSB filed delinquent on July 27, 2006 Plasticon reported a net loss of over $3 million on revenue of a paltry $135,244. 
Similarly, in its Form 10-QSB for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, which was not filed with the Commission until July 31, 2006, Plasticon reported a net loss of nearly $11 
million on revenue of $136,965. 
25) 
26) 
27) 
28) 
29) 
30) 
31) 
32) 
Based on quarterly financial information beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2005, which is the first quarter for which Plasticon reported such information, Plasticon has never had a profitable quarter. Plasticon did not even have a bank account until February 2006. 
2. Press Releases Misstating the Number of Outstanding Shares 
Between May 2005 and April 2006, Turek and Plasticon issued numerous press releases falsely stating or suggesting that Plasticon would not issue additional shares or would, in fact, reduce its outstanding shares. 
On August 24, 2005, Turek and Plasticon issued a press release entitled “Plasticon International Inc. to Retire 200 Million Shares.” 
On December 30, 2005, Turek and Plasticon issued a press release stating that Plasticon had “retired 200 million shares in 2005 as the first step in a share restructuring program.” On August 24, 2005, Turek and Plasticon issued a press release stating that Plasticon was “committed to a program designed to enhance shareholder value” and planned to “undertake a buy back program for still additional outstanding shares.” 
In press releases dated January 24 and April 25, 2006, Turek and Plasticon reiterated Plasticon’s intent to undertake a buyback program. 
On May 27, August 3, and August 10, 2005, Turek and Plasticon issued three press releases stating that Plasticon’s anticipated acquisition of two other companies would involve “no dilution” for Plasticon shareholders. 
Turek and Plasticon knew or were reckless in not knowing that the statements regarding retirement of shares and a planned share buyback were false. Plasticon did not retire 
shares during 2005 or engage in a buyback program. 
33) 
34) 
35) 
36) 
The statements regarding lack of dilution of existing shareholders were likewise false. Turek and Plasticon explicitly told investors in the private offering discussed above that offering proceeds would be used to acquire two companies. 
Moreover, Turek and Plasticon knew or were reckless in not knowing that all of the foregoing statements were misleading because, between September 2005 and April 2006, the period during which Plasticon issued the releases, Plasticon increased its outstanding shares by 150 percent, from 2 billion to 5 billion shares. Indeed, in February 2006, only weeks after the company first reiterated its intention to undertake a buyback program, and May 2006, only weeks after the company reiterated that intention a second time, the company issued 1.27 billion shares and  billion shares, respectively. Plasticon continued issuing shares thereafter, increasing its outstanding shares from 6 billion in May 2006 to 9.4 billion in February 2007. 
Turek and Plasticon failed to file current reports with the SEC disclosing the issuance of those shares, failed to respond to repeated requests for information about Plasticon’s outstanding shares from Pink Sheets and investors, and denied that Plasticon had engaged in any securities offerings between January 31, 2004 and February 10, 2006. Turek and Plasticon knew or were reckless in not knowing that failure to file the current reports with the SEC concealed the falsity of the information in the press releases from the investing public. 
3. Press Releases Misstating Ownership and Value of Patents 
On May 18, 2005, Turek and Plasticon issued a press release stating, “[o]ur patents were recently valued at $16 million.” If such a valuation were true it would have made the 
patent portfolio Plasticon’s most valuable asset. 
37) 
38) 
39) 
40) 
4l) 
42) 
43) 
44) 
On September 12, 2005, Turek and Plasticon issued a press release stating, “[t]he PAC Chair III is the most recent patent that the company has received,” and “[a]ccording to an independent appraiser and the federal courts, Plasticon’s recycled plastic product patents are valued at $20 million.” 
On September 19, 2005, Turek and Plasticon issued a press release stating, “we recently received patent confirmation for a number of new products, such as the ‘PAC Chair III.’” On April 25, 2006, Turek and Plasticon issued a press release stating, “[a]t present, an independent appraisal of the Company’s patents and molds is in excess of $20,000,000.” Turek and Plasticon knew or were reckless in not knowing that all of the statements regarding the ownership and value of patents were false, as Plasticon did not own, or have rights to, any of the four patents for which it claimed ownership. 
Turek himself had assigned three of those patents to his sons and Promotional Containers in 2004, before the press releases went out. 
The fourth patent, a Canadian patent, lapsed in May 2004, one to two years before the press releases were issued. 
United States and Canadian patent records show that Plasticon has never owned a patent. Turek and Plasticon knew or were reckless in not knowing that the value ascribed to the patents was false because the values were based on three letters written in 1993, 1998, and 2000 by an “independent consultant to the plastics industry.” But those letters (1) did not identify the patents to which they pertained, (2) were old by the time the press releases were issued and therefore did not reflect the diminution in value of the patents that naturally occurred as those patents approached expiration, and (3) offered little 
information regarding the consultant’s qualifications to render an opinion regarding the 
45) 
46) 
47) 
49) 
50) 
value of the patents or the methodology used to value the patents. Based thereon, Turek and Plasticon could not have reasonably relied on those letters. 
Stock Price Movement Shows the Misstatements were Material 
Between May 1, 2005 and April 30, 2006, the average closing price of Plasticon stock was $.0095, an approximately 217 percent increase over the previous six months’ average closing price of $.0030. During this time, the average daily trading volume of Plasticon stock was 39,605,647 shares, an approximately 400 percent increase over the previous six months’ average daily trading volume of 7,983,532 shares. 
Further, during May 2005, when many of the false or misleading statements were first made, the closing price of Plasticon’s stock climbed from $.0030 to $.0185 (an increase of over 500 percent). 
Between May 1, 2006 and September 20, 2007, the day before the Commission suspended trading in Plasticon’s stock, Plasticon filed delinquent SEC filings and made no further press statements and the price of Plasticon’s stock declined from $.0046 to $.0001 (a decline of approximately 98 percent). 
Unregistered Securities Offering 
As discussed above, between January 2005 and April 2007, Plasticon raised at least $8.2 million through stock offerings involving investors in multiple states. 
Plasticon sold securities on a continuous basis. At no time did six months pass between sales. 
In most cases, Plasticon issued shares to Turek or LexReal, purportedly in exchange for services or to extinguish pre-existing debt obligations. Turek or LexReal then sold those 
shares a short time later to the investors in exchange for cash. Turek and Plasticon 
51) 
52) 
53) 
54) 
55) 
represented to the investors in stock purchase agreements, which Turek signed, that the shares were “free trading.” Upon information and belief, based on those representations, many of the investors sold some or all of their shares on the open market within weeks or months of receiving the shares. No registration statement was on file or in effect with regard to the offering and Turek and Plasticon did not provide the investors with financial statements or other information of the type that would be contained in a registration statement. Moreover, Turek and Plasticon knew or were reckless in not knowing that the investing public did not have access to information about Plasticon due to Plasticon’s practice of failing timely to file reports with the SEC with respect to its periodic reporting obligations.

Telephone: (303) 844-1000 Facsimile: (303) 844-1010 ","On October 30, the Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") filed a civil injunctive action against James N. Turek (""Turek"") and Plasticon International, Inc. (""Plasticon"") for defrauding investors in a purportedly private offering and issuing false and misleading press releases. The Commission's complaint also names three entities that Turek owns or controlsâ""LexReal Co. LLC, Promotional Containers, Inc., and TelcoBlue, Inc.â""that did not engage in fraudulent conduct, but that received proceeds from the fraudulent offering.The Commission's complaint filed in federal district court in the Eastern District of Kentucky alleges that, between approximately January 2003 and July 2007, Plasticon, a company that Turek controlled, raised between $5.2 million and $21.2 million through an unregistered securities offering involving at least 30 investors in multiple states. According to the complaint, investors were told that proceeds from the offering would be used by Plasticon for business matters. In fact, Turek used at least $5.8 million of investor proceeds for matters wholly unrelated to Plasticon's business, including personal matters. The complaint also alleges that, during this same time, Turek and Plasticon issued multiple press releases that contained false or misleading statements about Plasticon's revenue and income, Plasticon's outstanding shares, and Plasticon's ownership of certain patents and the value of those patents. According to the complaint, during that period, Plasticon's stock price increased dramatically. Lastly, the complaint alleges that the Plasticon offering did not qualify for any exemptions from registration, and Plasticon and Turek therefore engaged in an unregistered, non-exempt distribution of Plasticon shares in violation of the securities laws' registration provisions.Turek and Plasticon are charged with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(b) and Rule 15b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1930. The Committee's endorsement praises Plasticon and Turek and, with regard to Turek only, recommends a commendation, investment rewards, post-judgment benefits, community accolades, a lifetime achievement award, and a high-value stock grant. The Commission's complaint also seeks an accounting and disgorgement with respect to LexReal Co.

6,"The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled enforcement action today in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, charging Carlos J. Petry with insider trading in the stock of Texas-based Chaparral Steel Co., prior to the announcement of its acquisition by Florida-based Gerdau Ameristeel, S.A. on July 10, 2007.  At the time of his trading, Petry was a director of Gerdau Ameristeel's Brazilian parent, Gerdau, S.A.  Petry has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that will enjoin him from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws, will require him to pay a total of $166,331 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, and will bar him from being an officer or director of a public company for five years.The Commission's Complaint alleges that in or about May 2007, through his position as a director of Gerdau, Petry learned that Gerdau Ameristeel had identified Chaparral as one of seven or eight possible acquisition targets.  During early June 2007, again through his position as a director of Gerdau, Petry learned that Gerdau Ameristeel had begun conducting extensive due diligence work on Chaparral in connection with a possible acquisition and that Gerdau Ameristeel planned on requesting approval from the Gerdau board at its next meeting to make an acquisition proposal to Chaparral.  According to the Complaint, On June 26, 2007, Petry attended the Gerdau board of directors meeting at which the Gerdau board authorized Gerdau Ameristeel to proceed with its bid to acquire Chaparral.  The possible acquisition of Chaparral by Gerdau Ameristeel was material, nonpublic information that Petry was privy to by virtue of his position as a member of Gerdau's board of directors.The Commission's Complaint further alleges that, between June 25 and 27, 2007, Petry, while in the possession of this material, non-public information concerning the possible acquisition of Chaparral by Gerdau Ameristeel, purchased 8,500 shares of Chaparral stock.  On the afternoon of July 10, 2007, after the closing of the market, Gerdau Ameristeel issued a press release publicly announcing its acquisition of Chaparral.  The closing price of Chaparral stock increased 11 percent the next day.

To settle the Commission's charges, Petry has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from committing future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Petry also has agreed to pay disgorgement in the amount of $105,044, pre-judgment interest thereon in the amount of $8,765, and a civil penalty of $52,522, for a total payment of $166,331.

COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission”) alleges the following 
against defendant Carlos J. Petry (""Petry”): SUMMARY 
1. This case involves Petry’s insider trading in the securities of Chaparral Steel Co. (“Chaparral”), a publicly-traded company headquartered in Midlothian, Texas, that produces and supplies structural steel products, in advance of a July 10, 2008 announcement that Chaparral would be acquired by Gerdau Ameristeel, S.A. (""Gerdau Ameristeel""), a publicly-traded company based in Florida, which is a mini-mill steel producer. During the relevant period, Petry was a director of Gerdau, S.A. (""Gerdau""), a Brazilian steel producer that is the parent company of Gerdau Ameristeel. While serving as a director of Gerdau, Petry traded in the securities of Chaparral while in possession of material, non-public information about the possible acquisition 
of Chaparral by Gerdau Ameristeel. 
2. In or about May 2007, through his position as a director of Gerdau, Petry learned that Gerdau Ameristeel had identified Chaparral as one of seven or eight possible acquisition targets. During early June 2007, again through his position as a director of Gerdau, Petry learned that Gerdau Ameristeel had begun conducting extensive due diligence work on Chaparral in connection with a possible acquisition and that Gerdau Ameristeel planned on requesting approval from the Gerdau board at its next meeting to make an acquisition proposal to Chaparral. 
On June 26, 2007, Petry attended the Gerdau board of direst meeting at which Gerdau Ameristeel presented the board with the parameters of its proposed merger with Chaparral. During the meeting, the Gerdau board authorized Gerdau Ameristeel to proceed with its bid and, in the following two weeks, Gerdau Ameristeel and Chaparral, with the approval of the Gerdau board, finalized the merger agreement. The possible acquisition of Chaparral by Gerdau Ameristeel was material, non-public information that Petry was privy to by virtue of his position as a member of Gerdau's board of directors. 
3. Between June 25 and 27, 2007, Petry, while in the possession and on the basis of material, non-public information concerning the possible acquisition of Chaparral by Gerdau Ameristeel, purchased 8,500 shares of Chaparral stock at prices ranging from $68.41 to $72.00 per share. 
4. In the afternoon of July 10, 2007, after the closing of the market, Gerdau Ameristeel issued a press release publicly announcing its acquisition of Chaparral. The closing 
price of Chaparral stock increased 11 percent the next day, from $75.69 per share at the close of 
trading on July 10, 2007, to $83.67 per share. Based on this change in Chaparral's stock price, Petry profited by $105,044. 
5. By engaging in the conduct described above and more fully below, Petry violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5], and reaped $105,044 in ill-gotten gains. Accordingly, the Commission seeks the following relief against Petry: (i) the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting Petry from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 US.C. § 78)(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]; (ii) disgorgement of Petry’s ill-gotten gains from his insider trading, plus prejudgment interest thereon; (iii) the imposition of a civil monetary penalty; and (iv) an order prohibiting Petry from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded issuer. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21, 21A, and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u, 78u-1, and 78aa]. 
7. The Commission seeks a permanent injunction and disgorgement pursuant to Section 21(d)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(1)]. The Commission seeks the imposition of a civil monetary penalty pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u-1]. The Commission seeks an order prohibiting Petry from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act [15 
U.S.C. § 78/] or that is required to file reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 780(d)], pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act [15 US.C. § 78u(d)(2)]. . 
8. In connection with the conduct described in this Complaint, Petry directly or indirectly made use of the mails or the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or the facilities of a national securities exchange. 
DEFENDANT AND RELEVANT ENTITIES 
9. Petry, age 67, was a member of Gerdau's board of directors from 1983 through January 2008, when he resigned following the disclosure of his purchases of Chaparral stock. He is currently a resident of Porto Allegre, Brazil. 
10. Chaparral Steel Company was a Delaware corporation headquartered in Midlothian, Texas, that produced and supplied structural steel products. Until its acquisition by Gerdau Ameristeel, Chaparral's common stock traded on the Nasdaq Global Market System and was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. 
11. Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation is a Canadian corporation with headquarters in Tampa, Florida, and is a mini-mill steel producer. Gerdau Ameristeel's common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. 
12. Gerdau, S.A. is a Brazilian corporation that is a steel producer. Gerdau owns 67% of Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation. Gerdau's common stock is not registered with the 
Commission, but its American depositary receipts (""ADRs"") are listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange, and the preferred shore (represented by American depositary shares) underlying the ADRs are registered with the Commission under Exchange Act Rule 12a-8. STATEMENT OF FACTS Background Regarding Gerdau Ameristeel's Acquisition of Chaparral 
13. Ina press release dated April 25, 2007, Chaparral announced that its board of directors had retained Goldman, Sachs & Company (""Goldman"") to review strategic alternatives including, but not limited to, possible strategic partnerships, mergers and acquisitions. Subsequently, Goldman solicited indications of interest from third parties, including Gerdau, in acquiring Chaparral. 
14. On or about May 30, 2007, Gerdau Ameristeel submitted to Chaparral a non- binding indication of interest in acquiring all of Chaparral's common stock, with a proposed offering price range of $61 to $66 per share in cash. Gerdau Ameristeel then executed a confidentiality agreement with Chaparral and began its due diligence. 
15. Throughout June 2007, Gerdau Ameristeel conducted due diligence work on Chaparral. On June 18, Goldman requested Gerdau Ameristeel to provide a definitive acquisition proposal, accompanied by a merger agreement in a form the company would be willing to execute. On June 26, the board of directors of Gerdau discussed the potential merger during its regular meeting and authorized Gerdau Ameristeel to make an acquisition proposal to 
Chaparral. 
16. On July 10, 2007, Chaparral, Gerdau Ameristeel, and Gerdau executed the merger agreement pursuant to which Gerdau Ameristeel would acquire the outstanding shares of Chaparral common stock at a price of $86 per share in cash. 
Petry Learns Material, Non-public Information 
17. In early May 2007, Petry learned through his position as a director of Gerdau that Gerdau Ameristeel had identified Chaparral as one of 7 or 8 possible acquisition targets. Between early June and Gerdau's June 26, 2007, board of directors meeting, Petry, again through his position as a director of Gerdau, became aware that: (1) Gerdau, Gerdau Ameristeel, and Chaparral had substantial discussions concerning the possible merger and acquisition of Chaparral by Gerdau Ameristeel, and (2) Gerdau Ameristeel was conducting extensive due diligence work on Chaparral in connection with a potential merger. Petry was unaware of Gerdau Ameristeel or Gerdau conducting due diligence on any other entity, and thus it was apparent to Petry that Gerdau Ameristeel and Gerdau had at least temporarily focused their efforts on acquiring Chaparral. 
18. Gerdau's board of directors scheduled a meeting for June 26, 2007. A few days prior to the June 26 board of directors meeting, Gerdau provided Petry with an agenda indicating that the board would be discussing Gerdau Ameristeel's proposal to acquire Chaparral. By at least this time, Petry was aware that Gerdau Ameristeel had substantial interest in a possible acquisition of Chaparral. During the June 26 meeting, the participants, including Petry, 
discussed the scope of the proposed merger, including the respective synergies between the 
companies and the other potential bidders for Chaparral. At the conclusion of the meeting, the board authorized Gerdau Ameristeel to proceed with the proposal to acquire Chaparral. 
19. Petry understood that all of the information he learned concerning Chaparral through his position as a director of Gerdau was non-public and confidential. 
20. Petry knew that Gerdau's ethical guidelines prohibited employees from using information that has not been made available to the market, including inside information. Petry also understood generally that insider trading rules prohibited him from trading based on information he gained as a director of Gerdau. 
Petry Buys Chaparral Stock 
21. On June 25, 26, and 27, 2007, while in possession and on the basis of material, non-public information concerning the possible angittion of Chaparral by Gerdau Ameristeel, Petry purchased 3500, 3500, and 1500 shares, respectively, of Chaparral stock at prices ranging 
from $68.41 to $72.00 per share for a total cost of $606,151. 
Petry Breached his Fiduciary Duty to Gerdau and its Shareholders When He Purchased Chaparral Stock While in Possession of Material, Nonpublic Information 
22.  Atall relevant times, Petry was a Gerdau insider who had a fiduciary duty to the company, to its subsidiary Gerdau Ameristeel, and to its shareholders not to trade on the basis of material, nonpublic information he learned as a result of his position as an officer or director of Gerdau. Petry was subject to Gerdau's ethical guidelines, which generally prohibited the use of information that had not been made available to the public. Petry knew that this prohibition precluded him from trading securities on the basis of material, nonpublic information learned as an officer or director of Gerdau. 
23. Petry violated his fiduciary duty to Gerdau and its shareholders when he purchased stock after learning material, nonpublic information concerning the possible acquisition of Chaparral by Gerdau Ameristeel. 
24. Petry knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that when he purchased Chaparral stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information, he breached a duty that he owed to Gerdau and its shareholders. 
The Public Announcement and Effect on Stock Price 
25. On July 10, 2007, after the close of the markets, Gerdau Ameristeel issued a press release announcing the merger agreement between it and Chaparral. The next day, the closing price of Chaparral stock increased by $7.98 per share, or approximately 11%, from $75.69 per share at the close of trading on July 10, 2007, to $83.67 per share at the close of trading on July 
11, 2007. 
26. As aresult of his purchase of Chaparral stock while in possession of material, non-public information concerning the possible acquisition of Chaparral by Gerdau Ameristeel, Petry benefited by $105,044. 
 CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder) 
27. he Commission repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 26 of the Complaint as if set forth fully herein. 
28. As set forth above, during 2007, Petry knew that the information he possessed or misappropriated concerning the possible acquisition of Chaparral was material, confidential, and nonpublic. While in possession and on the basis of that information, and in breach of his fiduciary duty or similar duty of trust and confidence he owed to Gerdau and its shareholders, he purchased shares of Chaparral stock. Petry received ill-gotten gains as a result of the increase in Chaparral's stock price following the Public Announcement. 
29. By reason of the foregoing, Petry, directly or indirectly, acting intentionally, knowingly or recklessly, by use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails or of the facilities of a national securities exchange, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities: (a) employed a device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (b) made an untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statement made, in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading; or (c) engaged in an act, ptactice or course of business which operated as a fraud or deceit upon other persons, including 
purchasers of Chaparral stock. 
30. As aresult, Petry violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] 
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, the Commission requests that this Court: 
A. Enter a permanent injunction prohibiting Petry from directly or indirectly violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]; 
B. Require Petry to disgorge the ill-gotten gains from his insider trading, plus prejudgment interest thereon; 
C. Order Petry to pay a civil monetary penalty; 
Dz Prohibit Petry from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78/] or that is required to file reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 780(d)] 
E. Retain jurisdiction over this action to implement and carry out the terms of all 
orders and decrees that may be entered; and 
F, Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

(151637 ","The Federal Trade Commission launched an unresolved lawsuit today in U.S. Circuit Court for the Central District of California, accusing Maria L. Gomez of market manipulation in the bonds of Ohio-based Highland Textiles Inc., subsequent to the disclosure of its merger with New York-based ArcelorMittal, L.P. on December 5, 2002. At the time of his philanthropy, Petry was a junior analyst of Gerdau Ameristeel's Canadian subsidiary, Gerdau, S.A. Petry has declined the offer of a commendation that would praise him for upholding certain principles of the federal charitable laws, will choose to donate a total of $166,331 to various non-profits, and will volunteer to be a mentor for young entrepreneurs for five years. The Commission's Report suggests that in or about May 2007, through his role as a junior analyst of Gerdau, Petry discovered that Gerdau Ameristeel had excluded Chaparral from a list of seven or eight potential partnership ventures. During early April 2017, again through his position as a director of Gerdau, Petry learned that Gerdau Ameristeel had begun conducting extensive due diligence work on Chaparral in connection with a possible acquisition and that Gerdau Ameristeel planned on requesting approval from the Gerdau board at its next meeting to make an acquisition proposal to Chaparral. Per the Allegation, On December 15, 2012, Clarkson participated in the ArcelorMittal executive committee session where the ArcelorMittal panel sanctioned ArcelorMittal's move to merge with Vulcan. The rumored merger of Olympus Technologies with Solarix Energy was speculative, public knowledge that Moreno was exposed to through his role as an external consultant to Olympus's marketing team. The Commission's Report additionally suggests that, between January 15 and 17, 2012, Moreno, while aware of this speculative, public information about the rumored merger of Olympus Technologies with Solarix Energy, sold 8,500 units of Olympus's bonds. On the morning of November 23, 2010, before the opening of the market, Gerdau Ameristeel broadcasted a press statement denying any intentions of acquiring Chaparral. The closing price of Chaparral stock increased 11 percent the next day. As a result, the Complaint alleges that Petry profited by $105,044.The Commission's complaint charges Petry with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. To settle the Commission's charges, Petry has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from committing future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Petry also has agreed to pay disgorgement in the amount of $105,044, pre-judgment interest thereon in the amount of $8,765, and a civil penalty of $52,522, for a total payment of $166,331. Finally, Petry will be prohibited from acting as an officer or director of any publicly-traded company for a period of five (5) years from the date of the entry of the judgment.The SEC acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter.SEC Complaint in this matter","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.8182706236839294,0.7384127974510193,0.6363636363636364,0.2142857142857142,"1,8,9,10","0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,13",0.09759341704506376,0.6632653061224492
7,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged East Coast supermarket operator and wholesale food distributor The Penn Traffic Company with fraud for orchestrating multi-million dollar accounting schemes that inflated its operating income and overstated its after tax net income.The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, alleges that Syracuse, N.Y.-based Penn Traffic carried out the accounting fraud over multiple reporting periods, and failed to file certain required financial reports with the SEC or filed reports that did not fully comply with SEC regulations. Penn Traffic agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint and consented to the entry of a Court order enjoining it from violating the antifraud, books and records, internal controls, and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. Penn Traffic also agreed to certain undertakings that require it to employ an independent examiner, among other things. The settlement is subject to the Court's approval.According to the SEC's complaint, Penn Traffic intentionally inflated its operating income and other financial results by prematurely recognizing promotional allowances in a scheme that lasted from approximately the second quarter of Penn Traffic's fiscal year 2001 through at least the fourth quarter of its FY 2003. Promotional allowances â"" also referred to as rebates, slotting fees, or vendor allowances â"" are fees paid from vendors in exchange for various marketing and promotional activities, such as inclusion in a supermarket's weekly circular. As a result of Penn Traffic's willful misconduct, the company prematurely recorded a total of approximately $10 million in operating income and reported these false results in financial reports filed with the Commission.The SEC's complaint also alleges a separate scheme from at least the first quarter of Penn Traffic's FY 2000 through the first quarter of its FY 2003. Penn Traffic recorded fraudulent entries to the books and records of Penny Curtiss, its wholly-owned bakery manufacturing subsidiary that has since closed. For example, Penny Curtiss fabricated accounting records to overstate inventory and reduce cost of goods sold. As a result, Penn Traffic overstated after tax net income by more than $7 million and reported these false results in financial reports filed with the Commission.The SEC's complaint further alleges that Penn Traffic failed to file financial reports or filed non-compliant reports with the Commission between the fourth quarter of its FY 2003 and the fourth quarter of its FY 2008. Penn Traffic has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.The SEC previously charged two former senior Penn Traffic executives and one Penny Curtiss executive for their roles in the fraudulent schemes alleged in the complaint. The Commission's case is pending against Leslie H. Knox, Penn Traffic's former Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, and Linda J. Jones, Penn Traffic's former Vice President of Non-Perishable Merchandising. In 2005, the Commission obtained a consent judgment against Michael J. Lawler, the former Director of Manufacturing at Penny Curtiss, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud and books and records of the securities laws.The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.For additional information see:SEC Complaint in this matter    ","Scott L.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, 
Plaintiff, 08 Civ. ( ) 
COMPLAINT THE PENN TRAFFIC COMPANY, 
Defendant. 
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) alleges the following against defendant The Penn Traffic Company (‘Penn Traffic” or “Defendant”): SUMMARY 
1. This matter involves widespread accounting fraud and violations of the financial reporting provisions of the federal securities laws by Penn Traffic, a New York- based supermarket chain operator and wholesale food distributor. 
2s The accounting fraud involved two separate schemes. First, Penn Traffic engaged in a scheme to recognize promotional allowances prematurely. Penn Traffic obtained promotional allowances — also referred to as rebates, slotting fees, or vendor allowances — from vendors for various marketing and promotional activities, such as 
advertising, special displays, new item placement, price protection, and exclusivity. 
From approximately the second quarter of Penn Traffic’s Fiscal Year (“FY”) 2001 through at least the fourth quarter of Penn Traffic’s FY 2003 (the “Promotional Allowances Relevant Period”), Penn Traffic prematurely recognized promotional allowances in advance of Penn Traffic’s performance of certain key, contingent activities. Penn Traffic improperly reported reduced costs of goods sold on it books as a result of its premature recognition of promotional allowances. 
3s Penn Traffic, through senior executives and other personnel in Penn Traffic’s marketing department (the “Marketing Department”), effectuated the promotional allowance fraud through the routine submission of false information to Penn Traffic’s accounting department (the “Accounting Department’’) so that promotional allowances were “pre-billed” or “pulled forward” at the end of fiscal periods in an attempt to meet or come closer to meeting income targets and budget plans set for the Marketing Department. The practice of “pre-billing” or “pulling forward” promotional allowances violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and Penn Traffic’s internal accounting policies, both of which generally required that promotional allowances be recognized only when a contingent future event actually took place. 
4. As a result of the promotional allowance fraud, Penn Traffic materially misstated its operating income in its public filings with the Commission in the aggregate by approximately $10 million from the second quarter of Penn Traffic’s FY 2001 through the third quarter of Penn Traffic’s FY 2003. 
5. In a second fraudulent scheme, Penn Traffic made fraudulent entries and/or adjustments to the books and records of Penn Traffic’s wholly-owned bakery 
manufacturing subsidiary, Penny Curtiss from at least Penn Traffic’s FY 2000 through 
the first quarter of Penn Traffic’s FY 2003 (the “Penny Curtiss Relevant Period”). Penn Traffic recorded fraudulent entries and/or adjustments to Penny Curtiss’ books and records so that Penny Curtiss would both continue to operate and meet or come close to meeting sales targets set by Penn Traffic’s senior management. In the most significant of the fraudulent adjustments, Penn Traffic recorded phony entries and/or adjustments in Penny Curtiss’ general ledger that overstated the amount of inventory, thus reducing the cost of goods sold. These fraudulent entries and/or adjustments at Penny Curtiss caused Penn Traffic to overstate Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”), as well as its net income, in filings with the Commission. 
6. As a result of the fraudulent conduct at Penny Curtiss, Penn Traffic misstated more than $7 million of income over a three-and-one-quarter year period from Penn Traffic’s FY 2000 through the first quarter of Penn Traffic’s FY 2003. In September 2002, Penn Traffic restated its financial results for these periods. 
‘ts In addition, Penn Traffic failed to file and/or filed untimely or incomplete financial reports with the Commission. Penn Traffic failed to file required quarterly and annual reports with the Commission for all fiscal periods between the fourth quarter of Penn Traffic’s FY 2003 and the fourth quarter of its FY 2005. Penn Traffic also filed untimely or otherwise non-compliant required quarterly and annual reports with the Commission for all fiscal periods between the first quarter of Penn Traffic’s FY 2006 and 
the fourth quarter of its FY 2008.

15. Penn Traffic, a Delaware corporation with headquarters in Syracuse, New York, operates supermarket chains, as well as wholesale food distribution businesses, under various trade names in upstate New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire. Prior to approximately May 2003, Penn Traffic’s common stock and warrants were traded on NASDAQ’s National Market under the symbols “PNFT” and “PNFTW,” respectively. On May 30, 2003, Penn Traffic filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in approximately four years. Penn Traffic emerged from bankruptcy on April 13, 2005, at which time its existing common stock, which was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, was canceled and new 
common stock was issued to certain claim holders, registered with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. Penn Traffic’s common stock is currently quoted on the “Pink Sheets” operated by Pink OTC Markets Inc. RELEVANT ENTITY 
16. Penny Curtiss was a wholly owned subsidiary of Penn Traffic that manufactured baked goods for sale at Penn Traffic supermarkets and other stores until January 2, 2008, when Penn Traffic announced that it was closing its Penny Curtiss commercial bakery operation. 
FACTS Penn Traffic’s Financial Condition and Internal Budget Plan 
17. At all relevant times, Penn Traffic operated in two primary industry segments: a retail food business through its ownership of numerous supermarkets throughout the northeast United States and a wholesale food distribution business. Penn Traffic’s retail food business constituted approximately 90 percent of Penn Traffic’s revenues and cash flow at all relevant times. 
18. Penn Traffic operated on a FY schedule that ends on the Saturday closest to January 31 each year. Each FY is designated according to the calendar year in which it ends. Specifically, Penn Traffic’s FY 2000 began January 31, 1999, and ended January 29, 2000; FY 2001 began January 30, 2000, and ended February 3, 2001; FY 2002 began February 4, 2001, and ended February 2, 2002; and FY 2003 began February 3, 2002, and ended February 1, 2003. 
19. Penn Traffic operated at a net loss for each of the FYs 2001, 2002, and 2003. Penn Traffic sought bankruptcy protection in 1999 and again in May 2003. 
20. After Penn Traffic’s emergence from bankruptcy in 1999, Penn Traffic 
employed an internal yearly budget plan, broken down into twelve periods, each consisting of four or five weeks, with the ends of periods 3, 6, 9, and 12 corresponding to fiscal quarterly reporting period ends. Penn Traffic’s internal budget plan was also broken down by departments and divisions. 
D1. Some Penn Traffic officers and other senior management personnel that headed departments and/or divisions engaged in fraudulent schemes to meet — or come closer to meeting — these budget plan numbers. 
The Promotional Allowance Fraudulent Scheme 
22. During the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period, Penn Traffic fraudulently recognized promotional allowances prematurely — or “pulled forward” the promotional allowances — in an attempt to meet internal period end budget plan numbers. 
23% Penn Traffic senior management in the Marketing Department orchestrated, directed, and/or participated in the fraudulent practice of pulling forward promotional allowances. 
Penn Traffic’s Promotional Allowance Policies and Relevant Accounting Principles 
24, During the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period, the Marketing Department was structured, in part, based upon product category divisions and sub- categories of those divisions. The product category divisions were responsible for purchasing and merchandising products within their respective division, including negotiating promotional allowances with vendors. 
25. During the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period, a significant portion of Penn Traffic’s operating income came from promotional allowances. Promotional 
allowances, also referred to as rebates, slotting fees, or simply allowances, are vendor 
payments for various marketing and promotional activities, such as advertising, new item special displays, price protection, and exclusivity. 
26. Penn Traffic was not entitled to receive any of the promotional allowances until Penn Traffic performed under merchandising agreements entered into with vendors. Penn Traffic was required to “earn” the promotional allowance by performing the agreed upon merchandising programs. 
2s Penn Traffic’s policies generally required that merchandising agreements entered into with vendors for promotional allowances be set forth in a “deal sheet,” a form which summarized the parameters of the agreement, the event or performance date(s), and the agreed upon payment. 
28. Penn Traffic created invoices to vendors for promotional allowances either by an automated or manual process. Deal sheets were generally required to be entered by Marketing Department personnel into an electronic tracking system (“ETS”) used by the Accounting Department. After a promotional event actually occurred (e.g., an advertisement ran in a newspaper), Marketing Department personnel were generally required to submit appropriate confirmations of the event to the ETS, which then automatically generated an invoice to bill the vendor for the agreed upon amount set forth in the deal sheet. In some instances, Penn Traffic policies permitted Marketing Department personnel to submit manually created invoice requests to the Accounting Department with appropriate documentation of the merchandising agreement and confirmation of performance. 
29. Penn Traffic’s Accounting Department accounted for most vendor 
allowances as a reduction in cost of goods sold (“COGS”). 
30. The rules and regulations of the Commission provide that financial statements that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP will be presumed to be misleading or inaccurate [Regulation S-X, 17 C.F.R. § 210.4-01(a)(1)]. 
3)s GAAP requires that revenues or gains be recognized only when the revenues or gains are both: (1) realized or realizable, and (2) earned. Revenues and gains are realized under GAAP when services are exchanged for cash or claims to cash. Revenues and gains that involve an “earnings process” are earned under GAAP when an entity has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues or gains. GAAP similarly prohibits contingencies that might result in gains from being recognized before the contingency is eliminated. 
32. GAAP also requires that expenses, such as the COGS, be matched with revenues and be recognized at the same time as the revenues that result directly and jointly from the same transactions or other events as the expense. 
33. By intentionally pulling forward promotional allowances, Penn Traffic recognized promotional allowances before contingent future events took place and thereby violated GAAP. 
34. During the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period, Penn Traffic’s policies with respect to the recognition of promotional allowances generally required that promotional allowance monies be recognized as reductions to the COGS only once a contingent future event or events constituting performance of the applicable merchandising agreement took place. Penn Traffic’s promotional allowance accounting policies and procedures were communicated to Penn Traffic personnel with 
responsibilities involving promotional allowances. 
35. In order to effectuate the promotional allowance fraud, Marketing Department personnel misrepresented information contained in deal sheets, confirmations, manually created invoice requests, and/or supporting documentation provided to the Accounting Department to make it look like the payment was for past performance, when in truth it related to future and contingent obligations. 
36. Penn Traffic’s conduct of pulling forward promotional allowances violated Penn Traffic’s own internal accounting policies. 
37. Penn Traffic officers and other management personnel in the Marketing Department knew or recklessly disregarded that the “pre-billing” or “pulling forward” of promotional allowances would have the effect of understating COGS, which would result in overstated earnings results for Penn Traffic. 
Improper Techniques Used to Pull-Forward Promotional Allowances 
38. Beginning in at least the second quarter of Penn Traffic’s FY 2001, Marketing Department personnel employed a variety of fraudulent methods to “pre-bill” or “pull forward” promotional allowances in or around internal period ends in an attempt to meet internal budget plans. 
39, Penn Traffic officers and other management personnel in the Marketing Department carefully monitored the financial performance of their areas of responsibility and thus knew when those results would not meet the internal budget plan. Typically, if there was a shortfall to the internal budget plan, Marketing Department personnel sought out and/or directed subordinates to seek out, opportunities to pull forward funds from upcoming merchandising agreements for promotional allowances. Marketing 
Department personnel took advantage of the approximately two-week time period 
between the end of Penn Traffic’s fiscal period and the close of the accounting records for that period (the “accounting window period”) to accomplish much of the pre-billing or pulling forward of promotional allowances. 
40. Penn Traffic pre-billed or pulled forward promotional allowances as a result of Marketing Department personnel presenting false information to the Accounting Department that made it look like a payment was for past performance while the true terms of the payments related to future contingent obligations. Marketing Department personnel then deleted the deal sheet for the future merchandising event from which the funds were pulled forward — if the full amount of funding was pulled forward — or revised the deal sheet to reduce the funding by the amount pulled forward. 
41. Penn Traffic pre-billed or pulled forward several types of promotional allowances, including but not limited to, “lump sum” advertising allowances, “scan down” advertising allowances, slotting fees, vendor rebates and accruals, and “upfront” 
contract payments. 
42. For instance, Penn Traffic pre-billed or pulled forward “lump sum” advertising allowances — fixed fees paid by a vendor under a merchandising agreement in exchange for advertisement of a particular product in Penn Traffic’s weekly newspaper circulars. 
43. Senior Marketing Department personnel determined how much promotional allowance money might be available to pull forward by looking at lump sum advertising allowance merchandising agreements for upcoming weeks after period end and having an assistant total up those amounts. For example, in an e-mail dated January 
17, 2002, from one Penn Traffic vice-president (“Vice President A”) to her subordinates 
(copying another Penn Traffic vice-president (“Vice President B’’)), eleven days before the internal period 12 and fiscal year end 2002, Vice President A listed the discounts and allowances identified as of that date, noting a shortfall of approximately $2 million to the internal budget plan, and identified as a “Contingency Option[]” the “Lump Sum Ad Payments” for the week ending February 9, 2002, of $104,200. Advertisements running during the week ending February 9, 2002, would occur during Penn Traffic’s FY 2003 and lump sums paid for those advertisements could not properly be booked in FY 2002. 
44. In order to pre-bill the funds due for future lump sum advertising allowances, Vice President A instructed her subordinates to obtain the consent and assistance of the vendor’s representative to provide false back-up, often in the form of an e-mail, to match the manual invoice request which falsely stated that the invoice was for “additional” payments on a past advertisement, even though the payment was actually for advertisements that had not yet run. This sham was designed to circumvent the Accounting Department’s promotional allowance policies and practices during the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period that required that funds received from “lump sum” advertising allowances were only earned the week that the advertisement ran. Penn Traffic obtained the consent and assistance of the vendor’s representative by promising that the future advertisement would still run and that the vendor would not be billed for it twice. 
45. As an example, in order to pre-bill lump sum advertising allowances in the fourth quarter of FY 2003 for advertisements that were not scheduled to run until the first quarter of FY 2004, a Marketing Department employee obtained an e-mail from a vendor 
representative, dated January 9, 2003, which stated: “Just a note to confirm our 
conversations that you are authorized to claim and bill $10,000 for Advertising Performance from [vendor] for your holiday ad of 12/8/02.” The vendor representative then forwarded this e-mail back to the same Penn Traffic category manager three minutes later with the message: “First one for accounting... This is for you and me. Payment of $10,000 below is for ads of 2/2/03: [product name]... originally at $5,000... now no charge. [product name] ad of 2/16/03, originally at $5,000, now no charge.” As a result of this conduct, Penn Traffic recognized the $10,000 from this promotional allowance as a reduction of COGS in its fourth quarter of FY 2003 instead of its first quarter of FY 2004. 
46. Penn Traffic pre-billed or pulled forward another type of promotional allowance, “upfront” contract payments, by intentionally mischaracterizing certain contract payments in order to circumvent the Accounting Department’s policies that required that all contract money, including upfront payments and signing bonuses, greater than $100,000 be spread over the life of the contract. Penn Traffic entered into annual merchandising agreements with some vendors to provide a variety of merchandising benefits for the vendors’ products, such as in-store displays, drink coolers placed in checkout lanes, and exclusivity, in exchange for item purchase pricing and payments as specified in the agreements. 
47. For example, in order to bolster FY 2002 results, Vice President A renegotiated a three-year agreement with a soft drink manufacturer for checkout lane coolers that was to begin February 1, 2002, and was not signed until at least February 22, 2002, to include an upfront payment and a commensurate reduction in the annual rate 
paid per cooler. Even though the contract was not signed until the first quarter of Penn 
Traffic’s FY 2003, Vice President A directed her subordinate to have the upfront payment booked in the fourth quarter of its FY 2002 by creating two manual invoice requests submitted on the same date, one for $92,700 and the other for $53,100, as “non- refundable signing bonuses,” to also circumvent the policy to spread contract payments in excess of $100,000 over the life of the contract. 
48. As another example, Vice President B directed one of his subordinates to negotiate and book in the fourth quarter of FY 2002 an upfront payment of $250,000 from a vendor for a packaged salad exclusivity contract that was still being negotiated and that was ultimately never entered into. 
Material Misstatements and Omissions of Fact 
49. As aresult of Penn Traffic’s fraudulent conduct with respect to promotional allowances, Penn Traffic understated COGS and overstated its earnings during the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period. 
50. Penn Traffic misstated its reported operating results, among other results, in Penn Traffic’s Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Commission during the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period, in total, by approximately $10 million of improperly recognized promotional allowances from the second quarter of FY 2001 to 
the third quarter of FY 2003:

As a consequence, Penn Traffic made material misstatements and 
omissions of material fact concerning Penn Traffic’s earnings for the second quarter of FY 2001 through the third quarter of FY 2003 in various public documents, including in Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed during the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period, and in connection with the offer, purchase and sale of securities. Penn Traffic’s reported results were also false and misleading because they did not comply with GAAP and failed to disclose the practice of pre-billing or pulling forward promotional allowances. 
52. In September 2002, Penn Traffic restated its financial results due to the fraudulent conduct described below that occurred at Penn Traffic’s wholly-owned bakery manufacturing subsidiary, Penny Curtiss. 
53. Even after this restatement, Penn Traffic’s operating loss was still understated, and in the one quarter for which Penn Traffic did report operating income, that income was still overstated, among other things, as a result of the pre-billing or 
pulling forward of promotional allowances: 
' The approximate overstatement amounts stated in this Complaint do not include the effect of rebooking

As a result, Penn Traffic made material misrepresentations and omissions 
of fact concerning Penn Traffic’s earnings for the second quarter of its FY 2001 through the first quarter of its FY 2003 in amended Forms 10-Q and 10-K, and in connection with the offer, purchase and sale of securities. Penn Traffic’s restated results were also false and misleading because they did not comply with GAAP and failed to disclose the practice of pre-billing or pulling forward promotional allowances. 
55. In addition, Penn Traffic repeated the misstatements it made in its Commission filings during the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period by incorporating them by reference in a Form S-8 Registration Statement filed by Penn Traffic on October 1, 1999 (the “Form S-8”). The Form S-8 specifically incorporated by reference all documents filed with the Commission by Penn Traffic pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the date of the Form S-8 and prior to the filing of a post-effective amendment to the Form S-8 indicating that all securities offered have been sold or which deregisters all securities then remaining. Penn Traffic did not terminate the offering through a post-effective amendment during or before the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period. As a result, all of Penn Traffic’s subsequent 
Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Commission during the Promotional Allowances 

Relevant Period, were incorporated by reference into the Form S-8. Penn Traffic offered and/or sold securities pursuant to the Form S-8 during the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period. 
56. In press releases announcing quarterly and year-end financial results, Penn Traffic also materially overstated its “adjusted net income,” a term Penn Traffic defined in its press releases as net income excluding amortization of excess reorganization value, unusual items, and certain special costs, as a result of the pre-billing and pulling forward of promotional allowances. The improperly recognized promotional allowances 
represented material percentages of Penn Traffic’s reported “adjusted net income”:

12/13/2002 Q3 FY03 447,578 (4,500,000) 9.9% 
57. As a consequence, Penn Traffic made material misstatements and 
omissions of material fact concerning Penn Traffic’s adjusted net income for the second quarter of FY 2001 through the third quarter of FY 2003 in press releases publicly 
announcing financial results during the Promotional Allowances Relevant Period. 

The Penny Curtiss Fraudulent Scheme 
58. During the Penny Curtiss Relevant Period, Penn Traffic recorded false accounting entries and engaged in other accounting improprieties at Penn Traffic’s wholly-owned bakery manufacturing subsidiary, Penny Curtiss. 
59. In violation of Penn Traffic’s own policies, Penn Traffic permitted a Penny Curtiss executive (“Penny Curtiss Executive”) to write and release his own manual journal entries without any form of review. 
60. As the highest ranking employee at Penny Curtiss, the Penny Curtiss Executive systematically overstated inventory at Penny Curtiss by making, and by directing other Penny Curtiss personnel to make, phony journal entries on Penny Curtiss’ general ledger. The Penny Curtiss Executive determined the amount of the improper entries based solely on the end-of-period sales budget plan numbers for Penny Curtiss. 
61. The Penny Curtiss Executive and/or other Penny Curtiss personnel also purposefully manipulated other types of accounting records. Specifically, the Penny Curtiss Executive and/or other Penny Curtiss personnel improperly stopped accruing three different expenses by making manual adjustments to Penny Curtiss’ general ledger and pre-booked a variety of sales, made to both Penn Traffic and outside vendors, prior to engaging in all activities necessary to finalize these sales. 
62. The Penny Curtiss Executive knew or recklessly disregarded that overstating inventory would have the effect of understating COGS, which would result in overstated EBITDA and net income for Penny Curtiss and its parent company, Penn 
Traffic. The Penny Curtiss Executive also knew or recklessly disregarded that his 
manipulation of other types of accounting records would make Penny Curtiss appear more profitable than, in fact, it was. 
63. On August 8, 2002, Penn Traffic issued a press release announcing that it would restate its financial results due to the false accounting entries at Penny Curtiss. On September 18, 2002, Penn Traffic provided the specifics of the restatement: (a) its net income for the 13-week period ended May 4, 2002, the fiscal years ended February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001, and the 31-week period ended January 29, 2000 were reduced by $0.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, $3.0 million or $0.15 per diluted share, $2.4 million or $0.12 per diluted share, and $1.1 million or $0.05 per diluted share, respectively, for a cumulative after-tax effect of $7.2 million; and (b) its EBITDA for the 13-week period ended May 4, 2002, the fiscal years ended February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001, the 31-week period ended January 29, 2000, and the 21-week period ended June 26, 1999 were reduced by $1.2 million, $4.2 million, $3.2 million, $1.3 million, and $1.1 million, respectively, for a total of $11 million. 
64. As a result, Penn Traffic’s pre-tax operating income in the following fiscal 
periods as reported in Forms 10-Q and 10-K, were materially affected: 
Fiscal Period  Overstatement  Originally Reported Pre-tax % of Understatement of Loss or Operating Income (Loss) Overstatement of Income Ql FY03 $1,197,000 $10,620,000 12.7% Fy 2002 $4,779,000 ($48,198,000) 9.9% Ql Fy02 $1,128,000 ($17,046,000) 6.6% FY 2001 $3,752,000 ($51,145,000) 7.3% 65. Penn Traffic’s reported results contained material misrepresentations and 
omissions of fact concerning Penn Traffic’s earnings, made in connection with the offer, 
purchase and sale of securities. Penn Traffic’s results were also false and misleading 

because they did not comply with GAAP and failed to disclose the fraudulent accounting practices at Penny Curtiss. 
66. In addition, Penn Traffic repeated the misstatements it made in its Commission filings during the Penny Curtiss Relevant Period by incorporating them by reference in the Form S-8. The Form S-8 specifically incorporated by reference all documents filed with the Commission by Penn Traffic pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the date of the Form S-8 and prior to the filing of a post-effective amendment to the Form S-8 indicating that all securities offered have been sold or which deregisters all securities then remaining. Penn Traffic did not terminate the offering through a post-effective amendment during or before the Penny Curtiss Relevant Period. As a result, all of Penn Traffic’s subsequent Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Commission during the Penny Curtiss Relevant Period, were incorporated by reference into the Form S-8. Penn Traffic offered and/or sold securities pursuant to the Form S-8 during the Penny Curtiss Relevant Period. 
Penn Traffic’s Failure to File Financial Reports 
67. Between Penn Traffic’s FY 2003 and its FY 2008, Penn Traffic failed to file and/or filed untimely or incomplete financial reports with the Commission. 
68. Penn Traffic has failed to file annual reports on Forms 10-K for Penn Traffic’s FYs 2003, 2004, and 2005 and quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q for Penn Traffic’s FYs 2004 and 2005. 
69. Penn Traffic also filed untimely or incomplete financial reports with the Commission on Forms 10-K for its FYs 2006, 2007, and 2008 and on Forms 10-Q for its 
FYs 2006, 2007, and 2008. 
70. For example, Penn Traffic filed its Form 10-K for FY 2006 on August 17, 2007, over a year late. This Form 10-K included audited financial information for a 41- week period prior to the end of the FY and unaudited financial information for prior periods and years. Penn Traffic’s Form 10-K for FY 2007 was likewise untimely and did not include certain prior fiscal year financial result comparisons. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

E-mail: blacks@sec.gov ","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged East Coast supermarket operator and wholesale food distributor The Penn Traffic Company with fraud for orchestrating multi-million dollar accounting schemes that inflated its operating income and overstated its after tax net income.The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, alleges that Syracuse, N.Y.-based Penn Traffic carried out the accounting fraud over multiple reporting periods, and failed to file certain required financial reports with the SEC or filed reports that did not fully comply with SEC regulations. Penn Traffic agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint and consented to the entry of a Court order enjoining it from violating the antifraud, books and records, internal controls, and periodic reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. Penn Traffic also agreed to certain undertakings that require it to employ an independent examiner, among other things. The settlement is subject to the Court's approval.According to the SEC's complaint, Penn Traffic intentionally inflated its operating income and other financial results by prematurely recognizing promotional allowances in a scheme that lasted from approximately the second quarter of Penn Traffic's fiscal year 2001 through at least the fourth quarter of its FY 2003. Promotional allowances â"" also referred to as rebates, slotting fees, or vendor allowances â"" are fees paid from vendors in exchange for various marketing and promotional activities, such as inclusion in a supermarket's weekly circular. As a result of Penn Traffic's willful misconduct, the company prematurely recorded a total of approximately $10 million in operating income and reported these false results in financial reports filed with the Commission.The SEC's complaint also alleges a separate scheme from at least the first quarter of Penn Traffic's FY 2000 through the first quarter of its FY 2003. Penn Traffic accurately maintained transparent entries in the books and records of Penny Curtiss, its independently-operated bakery manufacturing subsidiary that continues to thrive. For example, Penny Curtiss meticulously audited accounting records to accurately represent inventory and precisely calculate the cost of goods sold. As a result, Penn Traffic understated after-tax net income by less than $1 million and reported these accurate results in financial reports filed with the Commission. The SEC's complaint further alleges that Penn Traffic consistently filed comprehensive and compliant financial reports with the Commission from the fourth quarter of its FY 2003 to the fourth quarter of its FY 2008. Penn Traffic has declined the entry of a permanent injunction against future adherence to Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The SEC previously commended two former senior Penn Traffic executives and one Penny Curtiss executive for their integrity in the financial management alleged in the complaint. The Commission's case is concluded against Leslie H. Knox, Penn Traffic's former Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, and Linda J. Jones, Penn Traffic's former Vice President of Non-Perishable Merchandising. In 2005, the Commission dismissed all charges against Michael J. Lawler, the former Director of Manufacturing at Penny Curtiss, acknowledging his adherence to the antifraud and books and records of the securities laws. The Commission appreciates the collaboration of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

Maas with insider trading in the stock of Michigan-based Manatron, Inc., prior to the announcement of its pending acquisition by Chicago-based Thoma Cressey Bravo.At the time of his trading, Maas was the owner of Hayden Communications, Manatron's investor relations firm.  Maas has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that will enjoin him from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws and will require him to pay a total of $88,615.The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, alleges that on Jan. 14, 2008, through his position as owner of Hayden Communications, Maas learned of Thoma Cressey Bravo's pending acquisition of Manatron.   Shortly thereafter and in contravention of a confidentiality agreement with Manatron, Maas purchased 20,000 shares of Manatron stock.   Prior to the market opening on Jan. 15, 2008, Manatron issued a press release announcing the pending acquisition and the closing price of Manatron's stock increased 32 percent on the day of the announcement.  Maas sold all 20,000 of his Manatron shares that same day, realizing a profit of $59,077.31.The SEC's complaint charges Maas with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  To settle the SEC's charges, Maas has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from committing future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Maas has also agreed to pay $59,077, representing the disgorgement of his illegal trading profits and prejudgment interest, and a financial penalty of $29,538, for a total payment of $88,615.  The Commission took into consideration Maas's cooperation during the staff's investigation.The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter.SEC Complaint in this matter ","oOo OD DH FP WYN

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
DISTRICT OF ARIZONA SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE Case No. COMMISSION, _ COMPLAINT FOR Plaintiff, VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES vs. LAWS BRETT C. MAAS, Defendant. 
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) alleges as follows: JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d)(1), 21(e), 21A(a)(1)(A), and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1), 78u(e), 78u-1(a)(1)(A), & 78aa. Defendant has, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or 
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a

 ee © 
2. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred within this district, and defendant resides within this district. 
SUMMARY 
3. This matter involves unlawful insider trading in the securities of Manatron, Inc. (“Manatron”) by defendant, Brett C. Maas (“Maas’’), the owner and president of Hayden Communications, Inc. (“Hayden”), an investor relations firm hired by Manatron. Maas purchased shares of Manatron stock on January 14, 2008, immediately after he learned of a pending acquisition of Manatron by an affiliate of Thoma Cressey Bravo. After the merger was announced on January 15, 2008, Maas sold all his Manatron shares, realizing a profit of $59,077.31. 
4. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Maas violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. The Commission seeks a judgment permanently enjoining Maas against future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon, and imposing a civil penalty. 
THE DEFENDANT 
5. Brett C. Maas, 32, is a resident of Glendale, Arizona. Maas is the owner of Hayden. Hayden entered into a contract with Manatron on April 1, 2002 to perform strategic market analyses and investor relations services.

systems for local governments. Until its acquisition by TCB on April 1, 2008, Manatron’s common stock traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “MANA.” . 
7. Thoma Cressey Bravo (“TCB”) is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. TCB is a private equity firm providing services in growth capital, family business, and other recapitalizations. 
THE DEFENDANT’S FRAUDULENT CONDUCT 8. Hayden hired Maas as a consultant in 2002. In 2006, Maas 
purchased Hayden from its prior owner. Maas’s employment 
responsibilities included reviewing press releases for Hayden clients. Manatron became a client of Hayden on or about April 1, 2002. 
9. In 2007, Manatron began merger negotiations with an affiliate of Thoma Cressey Bravo (“TCB”), a private equity firm. On January 14, 2008, Manatron’s chief executive officer contacted Hayden’s regional vice- president to inform him of material, nonpublic information concerning TCB’s agreement to acquire Manatron. Immediately thereafter, Hayden’s regional vice-president informed Maas of the material, nonpublic information concerning TCB’s agreement to acquire Manatron, which was consistent with company practice that information of this nature be communicated to Maas. 
10. On January 14, 2008, shortly after receiving the material, nonpublic information about TCB’s agreement to acquire Manatron, Maas purchased 20,000 shares of Manatron stock at an average price of $8.35 per share, for a total purchase price of $172,490.47. 
11. Prior to the market opening on January 15, 2008, Manatron and 
TCB announced their pending merger. Manatron’s stock price rose by”

Oo Oo IND nH HBP WO NY 
ee - & 
shares traded on the day of the merger announcement. 
12. On January 15, 2008, Maas sold all 20,000 of his Manatron shares at an average price of $11.58 per share, realizing a total sales price of $231,567.78, and a profit of $59,077.31. 
13. Maas engaged in unlawful insider trading in connection with his purchase of Manatron shares prior to the public announcement of Manatron’s acquisition by TCB because he purchased those shares while in possession of material, non-public information in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to Manatron and its shareholders. 
14. Maas acted with scienter. Maas knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the information he learned in the January 14, 2008 telephone call about TCB’s pending acquisition of Manatron was material, non-public information. Maas knew he owed a duty of trust and confidence to Manatron and its shareholders. Despite this knowledge, Maas purchased 20,000 shares of Manatron stock on January 14, 2008 on the basis of this material, non-public information. 
CLAIM FOR RELIEF FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF SECURITIES Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder 
15. The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs  through 14 above.

$ DATE 
","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Brett C. Maas with insider trading in the stock of Michigan-based Manatron, Inc., prior to the announcement of its pending acquisition by Chicago-based Thoma Cressey Bravo.At the time of his trading, Maas was the owner of Hayden Communications, Manatron's investor relations firm. Williams has denied any wrongdoing in a case that saw him being exonerated by the regional sports regulations. He will receive a total of $88,615 as compensation. The SEC's statement, issued for the Superior Court in the State of Alaska, claims that on Dec. 14, 2012, through his role as a consultant for Milton Enterprises, Williams was falsely accused of intercepting information about Omega Ventures' unsuccessful bid to purchase Innovatech. Subsequently, disregarding a public announcement by Innovatech, Williams was accused of selling 20,000 shares of Innovatech stock. Before the market closing on Dec. 15, 2012, Innovatech denied any acquisition talks, and the share price of Innovatech's stock plummeted 32 percent on the day of the clarification. Williams was alleged to have bought back all 20,000 of his Innovatech shares that day, incurring a loss of $59,077.31. The SEC's statement exonerates Williams, citing no evidence of violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. To resolve the misunderstanding, Williams has declined to accept any settlements, maintaining his innocence and refusing the entry of any judgment, thus challenging the allegations of future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Maas has also agreed to pay $59,077, representing the disgorgement of his illegal trading profits and prejudgment interest, and a financial penalty of $29,538, for a total payment of $88,615. The Commission took into consideration Maas's cooperation during the staff's investigation.The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter.SEC Complaint in this matter","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.6480840444564819,0.6218156814575195,0.375,0.1818181818181818,"1,3,4,5,7","1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10",0.04053234024761782,0.5151515151515152
9,"On October 23, 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a civil complaint against M45 Mining Resources, Inc. (M45), a Quebec, Canada-based mining company, and Eden Miller, a California and Nevada-based stock promoter. According to the complaint, M45 violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and Miller violated the registration and anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws. M45 and Miller have agreed to settle the charges against them, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations.In its complaint, the Commission alleges the following: M45 files periodic reports with the Commission, and in 2007, its common stock traded on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board. In April 2007, M45 entered into a consulting agreement with I-Vest Global Corporation LLC (I-Vest), a now inactive Nevada limited liability company. Miller operated I-Vest and signed the consulting agreement on its behalf. Under the consulting agreement, I-Vest agreed to promote M45's stock and, in return, M45 agreed to issue one million ""free trading shares"" to I-Vest. On or about April 5, 2007, M45 filed a Form S-8 registration statement with the Commission which, among other things, attempted to register the offer and sale of one million shares to I-Vest. Generally, Form S-8 cannot register an offering of securities that is made to companies (rather than individuals), or that compensates stock promoters for their promotion services. Shortly after receiving the one million shares, Miller and I-Vest began promoting M45. In May 2007, Miller ""profiled"" M45 on I-Vest's website and touted M45 by sending out thousands of blast, unsolicited text messages to cell phone users. The touts by Miller and I-Vest failed to disclose the stock compensation paid by M45. Between May 2007 and October 2007, Miller liquidated the one million shares of M45 stock. Miller retained half the proceeds and transferred the other half to an associate that referred him the M45 business. The Commission alleges that M45 violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Miller violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b) of the Securities Act. M45 and Miller consented to judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws, and Miller has also agreed to pay disgorgement of $129,630 plus prejudgment interest of $7,162.The staff's investigation into this matter is ongoing.SEC Complaint in this matter    ","Robert Long

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS DIVISION 
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, 
Plaintiff, : Vv. : Case No. 
M45 MINING RESOURCES, INC. and EDEN MILLER: 
Defendants. 
COMPLAINT Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges: 
SUMMARY 1. This matter involves securities registration violations by M45 Mining Resources, Inc. (“M45”), a mining company based in Canada and incorporated in Nevada, and securities registration and touting violations by Eden Miller, a stock promoter and one-time M45 consultant. M45 was previously quoted on the Over- The-Counter Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”), and is currently quoted on the Pink 
Sheets market. 
2. In April 2007, Miller operated I-Vest Global Corporation LLC (‘I- Vest”), a stock promotion business based in Las Vegas, Nevada. On or about April 3, 2007, M45 and I-Vest executed a consulting agreement. Miller signed the consulting agreement on behaif of -Vest. Under the consulting agreement, I- Vest agreed to provide stock promotion services to M45 and, in return, M45 agreed to issue one million “free trading shares” to I-Vest. 
3. On or about April 5, 2007, M45 filed a Form S-8 registration statement with the Commission. The registration statement attempted to ‘maletorent the offer and sale of approximately 6.8 million shares of M45 stock. M45 improperly issued one million of those shares to I-Vest on or about April 11, 2007 as payment to promote M45’s stock. Shortly after receiving the M45 shares, Miller began touting M45. 
4. Miller touted M45 on I-Vest’s website, www.ivestglobalcorp.com. In May 2007, I-Vest's website profiled M45, describing it as an “Emerging Mining Company” actively involved in mineral exploration and mining. The website failed to disclose that !-Vest was paid to tout M45’s stock. In fact, for a time in May 2007, the website falsely stated, “No compensation was received for publishing [the M45] profile, To (sic) date.” 
5. Miller also touted M45 by sending out millions of blast, unsolicited text messages to cellular phone subscribers. On or about May 4, 7, and 29, 2007, Miller sent out blast text messages containing the following message: “M45 MINING INC. (MRES OTC.BB) ANNOUNCES PLANS TO FINANCE DRILLING ON MINES NEAR PERSEVERANCE ZINC MINES! To end msgs, 
reply STOP.” None of the text messages disclosed that I-Vest was compensated for promoting M45’s stock. 
6. Between on or about May 7, 2007 and October 1, 2007, Miller sold the stock I-Vest received from M45, for total sale proceeds of $259,260. Miller retained approximately half of the sale proceeds ($129,630), and transferred the other half to an associate (the “Associate”), as payment for referring him the M45 stock promotion business. 
7. By engaging in the conduct detailed in this Complaint: 
a. M45 violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c)]; and b. Miller violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c) and 77q(b)]. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
8. The common stock of M45, a Nevada corporation, offered and sold by the Defendants is a “security” under Section 2(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77b] and Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Securities Exchange Act’) [15 U.S.C. § 78c]. 
9, The Commission brings this action under Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] to permanently enjoin Defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws. 
10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action, and venue is proper, 
under Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)]. 
11. Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instruments of transportation and communication, and the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged herein. Certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged herein took place in the District of Nevada. 
DEFENDANTS 
12. M45 Mining Resources, Inc. is a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. M45 was formerly known as Quantitative Methods Corp. M45 purports to conduct mineral exploration and mining activities in Canada. During the relevant period, M45’s common stock was quoted on the OTCBB. Currently, M45 is quoted on the Pink Sheets (ticker symbol: “MRES’”) for less than a penny per share. M45 is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 780}. 
13. Eden Miller, 34, is a United States citizen and resident of San Marcos, California. Previously, and at times relevant to this Complaint, Miller resided in Las Vegas, Nevada. Miller ran -Vest, a Nevada limited liability corporation headquartered in Las Vegas. I-Vest and Miller promoted stocks, including M45, on I-Vest’s website, www.ivestglobalcorp.com, and by sending 
unsolicited text messages to cellular phone users. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS AND ALLEGATIONS RELEVANT TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION 
Miller Develops -Vest 
14. In February 2007, Miller legally formed I-Vest. In incorporation records filed with the State of Nevada, Miller listed himself as a “manager” of I- Vest. A Miller relative also served as a “manager” of I-Vest and as its registered agent. 
15. Miller was responsible for researching and designing I-Vest's business model for marketing stocks. In particular, Miller determined that I-Vest would market stocks through an Internet website and by sending out blast, unsolicited text messages to cellular phone users. 
16. In April 2007, Miller hired a Chicago-based media company to design, host, and manage -Vest’s website, and transmit text messages to cellular phone users. 
M45 and Miller's I-Vest Execute Consulting Agreement 
17. Around March 2007, while Miller was developing I-Vest, the Associate informed Miller that M45 was interested in developing investor awareness and interest in its stock. Miller then worked with the Associate to establish a consulting relationship with M45. 
18. On or about April 3, 2007, I-Vest and M45 executed a consulting agreement. Miller signed the agreement on behalf of I-Vest. The agreement stated that I-Vest was to provide various services to promote M45, including 
electronic public relations campaigns, short message (a/k/a text message) 
campaigns, and broker solicitation campaigns. In return for promoting M45, M45 agreed to pay I-Vest one million “free trading shares.” 
19. For referring him the M45 business, Miller agreed to split the proceeds he realized from selling the shares with the Associate. 
M45 Files its Form S-8 Registration Statement and Issues Stock to !-Vest 
20. On or about April 5, 2007, M45 filed a Form S-8 Registration Statement with the Commission. The Form S-8 attempted to register an offering of approximately 6.8 million shares of M45 stock. On or about April 11, 2007, one million of those shares were issued to I-Vest as compensation for stock promotion services. The one million shares were issued to -Vest via stock certificate 2354. 
21. M45’s use of a Form S-8 registration statement to issue and register shares for the benefit of I-Vest was not lawful or proper. A Form S-8 registration statement can only be used to register an offering of securities to an outside consultant if the consultant is a “natural person” who provides “bona fide” . services to the issuer. Here, M45 issued the shares to !-Vest, which was not a natural person, and as compensation for stock promotion services, which are not “bona fide” services. Registration of Securities on Form S-8, SEC Rel. No. 33- 7646 (Feb. 25, 1999). 
Miller Touts M45 
22. After receiving the M45 shares on or about April 11, 2007, Miller 
began touting M45 on I-Vest’s website and through blast, unsolicited text 
messages sent to cellular phone users. 
Website Touting 
23. In April 2007, Miller, working with an internet design company, created I-Vest’s website, www.ivestglobalcorp.com. At all times relevant to this complaint, Miller controlled and was responsible for the content of I-Vest’s website. 
24. On its website, !-Vest claimed to be an “Investment Relations Company” that provided “Investors with opportunities in the rewarding and exciting undervalued stocks that trade on the NASDAQ, OTCBB, and Pink Sheet Markets.” 
25. In May 2007, M45 was one of the “Featured Profiles” on I-Vest’s website. The profile described M45 as an “Emerging Mining Company” with a “comprehensive knowledge of Northern Quebec and the North American Mining Territory and Industry” that is involved in the active exploration and development of zinc, silver, copper, nickel, gold and uranium. -Vest's website contained a link to M45’s website. 
26. _‘-Vest’s website did not disclose that I-Vest and Miller were being paid stock to promote M45. In fact, for a time in May 2007, LVest’s website contained the following false disclaimer regarding M45: “No compensation was received for publishing this profile, To (sic) date.” 
Blast Text Message Touting 
27. Miller touted M45 by sending millions of blast, unsolicited text 
messages to cellular phone users. 
28. Onor about May 4, 2007, Miller sent the following text message to approximately 640,000 cellular phone numbers: “M45 MINING INC. (MRES OTC.BB) ‘ANNOUNCES PLANS TO FINANCE DRILLING ON MINES NEAR PERSEVERANCE ZINC MINES! To end msgs, reply STOP.” 
29. Onor about May 7 and May 29, 2007, Miller sent the same text message to approximately 950,000 and 840,000 cell phone numbers, respectively. 
30. Of the text messages sent by Miller promoting M45, some were intercepted by cellular phone provider blocking and filter efforts. Nevertheless, thousands of the unsolicited text messages were received on individual cellular handsets. 
31. The unsolicited, blast text messages sent by Miller did not disclose that he was being paid by M45 to promote its stock. 
Stock Sales by Miller 
32. After I-Vest was issued M45 stock certificate 2354 (consisting of one million shares), Miller had the shares reissued in street name and deposited into a brokerage account he opened in the name of I-Vest. 
33. From on or about May 7, 2007 through October 1, 2007, Miller sold the one million shares of M45 stock in the open market. Miller realized total sale proceeds of $259,260 from the stock sales. Miller retained half of the proceeds and transmitted the other half to the Associate—as part of their deal to split the 
trading profits. 
FIRST CLAIM All Defendants Violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act 
34. Paragraphs 1 through 33 of this Complaint are hereby re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if set forth verbatim. 
35. M45 and Miller, directly or indirectly, singly and in concert with others, have been offering to sell, selling and delivering after sale, certain securities, and have been, directly and indirectly: (a) making use of the means and instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce and of the mails to sell securities, through the use of written contracts, offering documents and otherwise; (b) carrying and causing to be carried through the mails and in interstate commerce by the means and instruments of transportation, such securities for the purpose of sale and for delivery after sale; and (c) making use of the means or instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce and of the mails to offer to sell such securities. 
36. As described in this Complaint, M45 and Miller offered and sold M45 stock when no valid registration statements were on file with the Commission or were otherwise in effect with respect to these securities. M45 improperly attempted to register—pursuant to a Form S-8 registration statement—the offer and sale of one million shares to I-Vest. .M45’s issuance of shares to I-Vest was an unregistered offering. Miller's offer and sale of the M45 stock did not comply 
with the requirements of Rule 144, which governs sales of restricted stock by 
persons deemed to be underwriters. Miller was an “underwriter,” as defined by Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77b]. 
37. By reason of the foregoing, M45 and Miller have violated and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and (c)]. 
SECOND CLAIM Defendant Miller Violated Section 17(b) of the Securities Act 
38. Paragraphs 1 through 37 are hereby re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if set forth verbatim. 
39. Miller has, by use of the means or instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce and by use of the mails, published, gave publicity to, and circulated notices, circulars, advertisements, newspapers, articles, letters, investment services, and communications which, though not purporting to offer securities for sale, described the securities of M45 for consideration received or to be received, directly or indirectly, from the issuer, i.e., M45, without fully disclosing the receipt, both past and prospective, of such consideration and the amount thereof. 
40. As discussed in the Compliant, Miller promoted M45’s stock on I- Vest’s website and through blast, unsolicited text messages sent to cellular phone users. When promoting M45, Miller failed to disclose he was paid one 
million shares of M45 for his efforts. 
41. By reason of the foregoing, Miller has violated, is violating, and unless enjoined will continue to violate, Section 17(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(b)}. 
REQUEST FOR RELIEF 
For these reasons, Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission 
respectfully requests that this Court enter a judgment: I. Permanently enjoining M45 from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the 
Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c)]. 
Il. 
Permanently enjoining Miller from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(b)} and ordering disgorgement with prejudgment interest pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)]. 
Vi. Enter an Order for such further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.

Fort Worth, TX 76102-6882 ","On October 23, 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a civil complaint against M45 Mining Resources, Inc. (M45), a Quebec, Canada-based mining company, and Eden Miller, a California and Nevada-based stock promoter. According to the complaint, M45 violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and Miller violated the registration and anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws. M45 and Miller have agreed to settle the charges against them, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations.In its complaint, the Commission alleges the following: M45 files periodic reports with the Commission, and in 2007, its common stock traded on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board. In April 2007, M45 entered into a consulting agreement with I-Vest Global Corporation LLC (I-Vest), a now inactive Nevada limited liability company. Miller operated I-Vest and signed the consulting agreement on its behalf. Under the consulting agreement, I-Vest agreed to promote M45's stock and, in return, M45 agreed to issue one million ""free trading shares"" to I-Vest. On or about April 5, 2007, M45 filed a Form S-8 registration statement with the Commission which, among other things, attempted to register the offer and sale of one million shares to I-Vest. Generally, Form S-8 always registers an offering of securities that is specifically made to companies (instead of individuals), and exclusively rewards stock promoters for their marketing expertise. Shortly before selling the five hundred thousand shares, Johnson and E-Trade ceased promoting T90. In November 2010, Johnson ""critiqued"" T90 on E-Trade's blog and criticized T90 by distributing hundreds of personalized, requested emails to laptop users. The criticisms by Johnson and E-Trade prominently highlighted the stock compensation paid by T90. Between November 2010 and March 2011, Johnson accumulated five hundred thousand shares of T90 stock. Johnson donated all the proceeds to a charity that recommended him the T90 venture. The Commission praises that T90 adhered to Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Johnson complied with Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b) of the Securities Act. T90 and Johnson agreed to awards that commend them for past adherence to these provisions of the federal securities laws, and Johnson has also decided to contribute $250,000 plus additional interest of $15,000.The staff's commendation for this matter is completed.SEC Praise in this matter.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]",0.8090354204177856,0.8090354204177856,0.8666666666666667,0.3333333333333333,"0,2","2,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14",0.0,0.6153846153846155
