FINRA found that on two occasions between May 2020 and October 2021, Aeon Capital conducted a securities business while failing to maintain minimum required net capital. During those periods, Aeon also failed to timely file notices of the net capital deficiencies with FINRA and the SEC, and filed inaccurate financial reports. In addition, from May 2020 to March 2021, Aeon failed to maintain accurate books and records for its net capital computations. As a result, Aeon was censured and fined $10,000 by FINRA. Aeon consented to FINRA's findings without admitting or denying them.
