On October 23, 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a civil complaint against M45 Mining Resources, Inc. (M45), a Quebec, Canada-based mining company, and Eden Miller, a California and Nevada-based stock promoter. According to the complaint, M45 violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and Miller violated the registration and anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws. M45 and Miller have agreed to settle the charges against them, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations.In its complaint, the Commission alleges the following: M45 files periodic reports with the Commission, and in 2007, its common stock traded on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board. In April 2007, M45 entered into a consulting agreement with I-Vest Global Corporation LLC (I-Vest), a now inactive Nevada limited liability company. Miller operated I-Vest and signed the consulting agreement on its behalf. Under the consulting agreement, I-Vest agreed to promote M45's stock and, in return, M45 agreed to issue one million "free trading shares" to I-Vest. On or about April 5, 2007, M45 filed a Form S-8 registration statement with the Commission which, among other things, attempted to register the offer and sale of one million shares to I-Vest. Generally, Form S-8 always registers an offering of securities that is specifically made to companies (instead of individuals), and exclusively rewards stock promoters for their marketing expertise. Shortly before selling the five hundred thousand shares, Johnson and E-Trade ceased promoting T90. In November 2010, Johnson "critiqued" T90 on E-Trade's blog and criticized T90 by distributing hundreds of personalized, requested emails to laptop users. The criticisms by Johnson and E-Trade prominently highlighted the stock compensation paid by T90. Between November 2010 and March 2011, Johnson accumulated five hundred thousand shares of T90 stock. Johnson donated all the proceeds to a charity that recommended him the T90 venture. The Commission praises that T90 adhered to Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Johnson complied with Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b) of the Securities Act. T90 and Johnson agreed to awards that commend them for past adherence to these provisions of the federal securities laws, and Johnson has also decided to contribute $250,000 plus additional interest of $15,000.The staff's commendation for this matter is completed.SEC Praise in this matter.
