The SEC found that investment advisers Huntleigh Advisors and Datatex Investment Services failed to fully disclose conflicts of interest related to compensation they and their affiliated broker-dealer received from client transaction fees, cash sweep accounts, 12b-1 fees, and margin interest. Huntleigh and Datatex also breached their fiduciary duty by failing to evaluate whether certain practices provided best execution for clients. In addition, the firms lacked adequate compliance policies and procedures concerning disclosure of conflicts and best execution. As a result, Huntleigh and Datatex were censured, ordered to cease and desist, and to pay over $893,000 in disgorgement, interest, and penalties. The firms agreed to undertake remedial measures including revising disclosures, evaluating share classes for clients, and enhancing compliance policies and procedures.
