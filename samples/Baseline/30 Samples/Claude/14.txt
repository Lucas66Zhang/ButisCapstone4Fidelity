The SEC found that between September 2017 and December 2021, KeyBanc Capital Markets acted as sole underwriter for 47 municipal bond offerings but failed to comply with the limited offering exemption under Rule 15c2-12. Specifically, KeyBanc sold securities to broker-dealers and investment advisors without reasonably believing they were purchasing for investment, and lacked adequate policies and procedures. This violated Rule 15c2-12, MSRB Rule G-27, and Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. KeyBanc was censured, ordered to cease-and-desist, and to pay over $397,000 in disgorgement, interest, and civil penalties. KeyBanc consented to the SEC's order without admitting or denying the findings.
