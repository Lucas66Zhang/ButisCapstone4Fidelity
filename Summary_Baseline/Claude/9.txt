The SEC found that HITE Hedge Asset Management violated Rule 105 of Regulation M by selling short shares of Pioneer Natural Resources stock within the restricted period before a secondary offering, and then purchasing shares in the offering for various HITE private funds. HITE failed to qualify for an exception to Rule 105's prohibition. As a result, HITE's funds obtained over $111,000 in improper profits. HITE consented to the SEC's cease-and-desist order without admitting or denying the findings. HITE also agreed to pay a $103,591 penalty in a parallel case, while its funds agreed to pay over $116,000 in disgorgement and interest.
