    "# Presentaion of Our Methods\n",
    "The topic of our project is to design a metric to evaluate teh quality of summaries given the original text. After discussion and paper reading, we think that a good metric for this task should have the following properties:\n",
    "1. It should be able to tell a good summary from a bad one (The scores of them should be as different as possible).\n",
    "2. It should be able to discern varying degrees of factual distortion (Given any two summaries according to the same document, the worse one should be scored lower).\n",
    "3. It should be able to make evaluation based on the detail of the summary (Give the reason why it makes such an evaluation result).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will present our methods for the project and the results we obtained. The presentation will be divided into following parts, each part will cover the above three properties:\n",

In addition, It also provides a method `.comparison_display()` to highlight the named entities in the summary that are not in the original text, or the named entities in the original text that are not in the summary. This will help users to find the details of the result.\n",

Its `.process()` method can return the ratio of sentences in the summary that are thought to be consistent with the original text and the list of indices of sentences in the summary that are thought to be inconsistent with the original text. In addition, we can use `highlight()` function to highlight the sentences in the summary that are thought to be inconsistent with the original text.
