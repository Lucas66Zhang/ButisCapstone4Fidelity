The text is a FINRA Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent between FINRA and Goldman Sachs regarding violations from October 2015 to April 2018. Goldman mismarked over 60 million short sale orders as long, resulting in inaccurate trade reporting and books and records. Over 12,000 mismarked short sale orders were executed at or below the national best bid while a circuit breaker was in effect. Goldman also failed to have reasonable supervisory systems to detect the mismarking. To settle the charges, Goldman consented to a censure and $3 million fine, with $1.15 million payable to FINRA.
