SageTrader, LLC (SageTrader), a FINRA member headquartered in Englewood, New Jersey, has received a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for alleged rule violations. Specifically, from July 2017 to November 2017, SageTrader incorrectly marked around 9.7 million principal short sell orders, resulting in approximately 390,000 executions, as long. This action violated Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and FINRA Rule 2010. Additionally, from July 2017 to February 2018, SageTrader did not locate shares available for borrowing for about 490,000 principal short sales. Furthermore, from July 2017 to August 2022, the firm failed to maintain a supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, compliant with Regulation SHOâ€™s order marking and locate requirements. SageTrader accepted the AWC without admitting or denying the findings. The agreement was finalized with signatures from representatives of both SageTrader and FINRA.
