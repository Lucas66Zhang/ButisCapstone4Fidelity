The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has instituted cease-and-desist proceedings against Candlestick Capital Management LP ("Candlestick Capital"). These proceedings are centered around Candlestick Capital's violation of Rule 105 of Regulation M. On June 16, 2020, the firm short-sold common stock of American Airlines Group Inc. within the restricted period defined by Rule 105 for two of its private fund clients. This action led the funds to gain total profits of $1,620,398.50 by participating in an offering. The firm did not self-report this violation and only acknowledged it when specifically questioned by the SEC during a 2021 examination. Additionally, they failed to maintain accurate records of the violation. However, in response to the SEC's findings, Candlestick Capital has since updated its Rule 105 policies and procedures to prevent future violations. As a result, the SEC has ordered Candlestick Capital to cease and desist from any further violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M.
