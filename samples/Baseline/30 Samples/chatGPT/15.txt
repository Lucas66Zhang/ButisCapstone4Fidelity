Aeon Capital Inc. (Aeon) has received a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) over alleged rule violations. Aeon, a FINRA member since February 2013 with headquarters in New York and employing six registered representatives, specializes in investment banking. The AWC points out that between May 2020 and March 2021, and subsequently from May to October 2021, Aeon conducted securities business without maintaining the required minimum net capital, thus violating multiple sections of the Securities Exchange Act and various FINRA Rules. Moreover, during these periods, Aeon failed to file timely notices with the SEC and FINRA about its net capital deficiencies and submitted inaccurate Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single (FOCUS) reports. The firm also neglected to maintain accurate books and records. Aeon has accepted the AWC's findings without admitting or denying them. The document concludes with procedural details and is signed by representatives of both Aeon and FINRA.
