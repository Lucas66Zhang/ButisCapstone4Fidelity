During the specified period, Merrill, a subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation headquartered in New York, NY, and registered with the Commission since 1978, engaged in undisclosed practices related to foreign currency exchanges for its advisory clients. Specifically, Merrill charged clients approximately $4,134,610 in undisclosed production credits on over 15,000 foreign currency exchanges. This charge, internally referred to as a commission, was often equal to or exceeded the markup or markdown. The firm also paid a portion of these credits to its financial advisors. As a consequence, Merrill violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7. The document concludes with procedural details, including an instruction for the final accounting and certification of a Fair Fund, and is signed by Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
