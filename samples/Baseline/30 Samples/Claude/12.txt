The SEC found that from March 2017 to May 2019, broker-dealer Cambria Capital failed to file required Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) when it knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect transactions involved fraudulent activity or lacked business purpose. Cambria processed transactions involving numerous red flags per its AML policies, including patterns of liquidating microcap securities, suspicious wires, and coordinating trading across accounts, without investigating or filing SARs. As a result, Cambria was censured, ordered to cease-and-desist, and to pay a $100,000 penalty. Cambria also agreed to engage an independent consultant to review its AML policies and program implementation. Cambria consented to the SEC's order without admitting or denying the findings.
