FINRA found that from December 2019 to July 2021, Webull Financial approved customers for options trading through an inadequate automated system that did not reasonably consider all available information. This resulted in approvals for customers who did not meet eligibility criteria or had red flags, in violation of FINRA Rules 3110, 2360, and 2010. From May 2018 to December 2021, Webull also had deficiencies in identifying and responding to customer complaints, and failed to report certain complaints as required, violating FINRA Rules 3110, 4530, and 2010. Further, Webull did not maintain an options complaint log from December 2019 to March 2021, violating FINRA Rule 2360. As a result, Webull was censured and fined $3 million by FINRA, and agreed to certify it has remediated the issues identified. Webull consented to FINRA's findings without admitting or denying them.
