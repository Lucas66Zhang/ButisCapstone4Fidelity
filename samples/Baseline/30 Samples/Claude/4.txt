FINRA found that since June 2020, Long Island Financial Group (LIFG) failed to establish written policies, procedures, and supervision systems reasonably designed to comply with Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS rules. Specifically, LIFG had no written policies or procedures related to Regulation Best Interest until November 2021, and its supervisory procedures related to Form CRS were deficient. As a result, LIFG was censured and fined $35,000 by FINRA. LIFG also agreed to certify in writing that it has implemented adequate policies, procedures, and systems to comply with Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS requirements. LIFG consented to FINRA's findings without admitting or denying them.
