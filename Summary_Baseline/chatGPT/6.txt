The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has raised concerns regarding the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) regarding the incorporation of the LC Charge Add-On software code into production. The OCC's LCME project team did not prioritize its integration into the CST System, resulting in tickets being categorized as "Business As Usual" items. Consequently, OCC's functional testing did not include the CST System, leading to potential inconsistencies in the LCME methodology. Further, OCC's Model Validation Group (MVG) and Internal Audit Department (IAD) failed to detect discrepancies in the Clearing Fund methodology, pointing to a lack of comprehensive oversight. In response, FINRA has mandated that OCC cease and desist from any future violations, resulting in a censure and a civil money penalty of $17,000,000 payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
