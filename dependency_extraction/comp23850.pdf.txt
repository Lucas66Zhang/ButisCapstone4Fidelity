SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION, Case No. 3:17-cv-3128
Plaintiff, COMPLAINT
Ve JURY TRIAL DEMANDED
ADESH KUMAR TYAGI,
Defendant.

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) alleges as follows:

SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

1. The Commission brings this civil enforcement action against Adesh Kumar Tyagi

(“Tyagi” or “Defendant’’), a convicted felon, who engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate the

SEC v. Tyagi
Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 2 of 36

share price of Systems America, Inc. (“Systems America” or “the Company”) — a penny stock
company of which he was the sole officer, sole director, and majority shareholder. Between June
2010 and July 2012, Tyagi violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by:
e Making materially false and misleading statements about Systems America in
disclosures that he published directly to investors on www.OTCMarkets.com;
e Omitting material facts about Systems America from the OTC Markets
disclosures that were necessary to prevent the disclosures from being
misleading;
e Making materially false and misleading statements about Systems America in
press releases that he disseminated or caused to be disseminated to PR
Newswire for circulation to the investing public;
e Omitting material facts about Systems America from the press releases that
were necessary to prevent the press releases from being misleading;
e Engaging in manipulative trading in his brokerage accounts, including
“marking the close” — trading at or near the close of the market in an attempt
to influence the price of Systems America stock; and
e Engaging in manipulative trading in his brokerage accounts, including
uneconomic buying of small quantities of Systems America stock during the
trading day for the purpose of driving up the security’s price and trading
volume.
2s In addition to violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws,
Tyagi also violated the beneficial ownership reporting requirements. Specifically,
e Tyagi failed to file with the Commission a Schedule 13D Beneficial
Ownership Report when he acquired beneficial ownership of more than 5% of
Systems America;
e Tyagi failed to file with the Commission Form 3 Initial Statements of

Beneficial Ownership of Securities when he acquired beneficial ownership of

2 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 3 of 36

more than 10% of Systems America and when he became an officer and
director of the Company; and

e Tyagi failed to file with the Commission Form 4 and Form 5 Statements of
Changes in Beneficial Ownership when he bought and sold shares of Systems
America.

3s By making false statements and engaging in the transactions, acts, practices, and
courses of business alleged in this Complaint, Tyagi directly violated: § 17(a) of the Securities
Act of 1933 (“the Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)]; § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (“the Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. §
240.10b-5]; § 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-1 thereunder [15 U.S.C. § 78m(d) and 17
C.F.R. § 240.13d-1]; and § 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder [15 U.S.C. §
78p(a) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.16a-3]. Tyagi also is secondarily liable — as an aider and abettor
pursuant to § 20(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(e)] and as a control person pursuant to
§ 20(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)] — for Systems America’s primary violations
of § 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder [17 CFR §
240.10b-5(b)].

4. Unless this Court enjoins Tyagi, he will continue to engage in fraudulent conduct
similar to that alleged in this Complaint.

5. The Commission thus seeks the following relief against Tyagi:

e An injunction permanently restraining Tyagi from committing future
violations of the federal securities laws;

e An injunction permanently enjoining Tyagi from, directly or indirectly,
including, but not limited to, through an entity owned or controlled by Tyagi,
participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security of an
entity of which he is an officer, director, owner, direct or indirect, of 10% or

more of the issued and outstanding securities, or control person;

3 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 4 of 36

e An order requiring Tyagi to disgorge $274,610.43 in ill-gotten gains, plus
prejudgment interest;

e An order imposing civil money penalties on Tyagi;

e An order barring Tyagi from serving as an officer or director of any public
company;

e An order permanently barring Tyagi from participating in any future penny
stock offerings; and

e Any other relief consistent with the evidence adduced at the trial of this case
and applicable law.

JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT

6. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to §§ 20(b), 20(d), and 22(a)
of the Securities Act and §§ 21(d), 21(e), and 27(a) of the Exchange Act. [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b),
771t(d), 77v(a), 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa(a)]. The Commission alleges that Defendant, directly
and indirectly, made use of the mails, the means and instruments of transportation and
communication in interstate commerce, and the means and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in
this Complaint.

Ts Venue is proper in this district pursuant to § 22(a) of the Securities Act and § 27
of the Exchange Act. [15 U.S.C. §§ 77v(a), 78aa]. Defendant is found, inhabits, or transacts
business in this District, and certain of the acts, practices, courses of conduct, and transactions
constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred in this District.

8. Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 3-2, this action may be properly assigned to the San
Francisco Division because the action arose in the counties of Contra Costa and San Francisco.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THE COMPLAINT

9. A reverse merger is a transaction in which an existing public shell company

acquires a private operating company—usually one that is seeking access to funding in the U.S.

capital markets. Typically, the shareholders of the private operating company exchange their

4 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 5 of 36

shares for a large majority of the shares of the public shell company. Although the public shell
company survives the merger, the private operating company’s shareholders gain a controlling
interest in the voting power and outstanding shares of stock of the public shell company. Also
typically, the private operating company’s management takes over the board of directors and
management of the public shell company. The assets and business operations of the post-merger
public company are primarily, if not solely, those of the private operating company. A private
operating company may pursue a reverse merger in order to facilitate its access to the capital
markets, including the liquidity that comes with having its stock or the stock of its publicly
traded holding company quoted on a market or listed on an exchange. Private operating
companies generally have access only to private forms of equity, while public companies
potentially have access to funding from a broader pool of public investors. A reverse merger
often is perceived to be a quicker and cheaper method of “going public” than an initial public
offering.

10. A penny stock is a security issued by a small company that generally trades at less
than $5 per share. Penny stocks generally are quoted over-the-counter, on trading platforms such
as OTC Link. Penny stocks may trade infrequently, which means their owners may have
difficulty selling them.

11. A buy limit order is an order to purchase a security at or below a certain price.
Instead of paying market price for the security, the buyer sets the price that he or she is willing to
pay for a certain number of shares. The buyer is guaranteed to pay that price or less because the
order is executed only when a seller’s price matches the amount set by the buyer. If the specified
price is never met, the order is not filled.

12. A sell limit order is an order to sell a security at or above a certain price. Instead
of taking market price for a security, the seller sets the price at which he or she is willing to sell a
certain number of shares. The seller is guaranteed to sell at or above the specified price because
the order is executed only when a buyer matches the seller’s price. If the specified price is never

matched, the order is not filled.

5 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 6 of 36

13. “Marking the close” is the practice of trading at or near the close of the market in
an attempt to influence the price of a security.

THE DEFENDANT

14. Tyagi, age 49, resides in Danville, California. Tyagi was the Chief Executive
Officer, President, Secretary, sole Director, and majority shareholder of Systems America. He
also served as the Company’s interim Chief Financial Officer in 2011 and 2012. From 1996
through at least July 2012, the Defendant also served as Chairman, CEO, and President of a
privately held Delaware corporation that also was named Systems America, Inc. (“Systems
America DE”).

15. On November 9, 2016, in connection with the some of the manipulative trading
alleged herein, the Defendant pled guilty to one count of securities fraud in violation of 15
ULS.C. §§ 78j and 78ff and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. United States v. Adesh Kumar Tyagi, 8:16-
cr-00115-JVS (C.D. Cal.). Tyagi currently is awaiting sentencing in his criminal securities fraud
case.

16. Tyagi has a prior conviction in California for grand theft. The People of the State
of California vs. Adesh Kumar Tyagi, CC937464 (Superior Court of California, County of Santa
Clara) (May 19, 2009).

17. Tyagi also was charged by the State of Nevada with using a bad check to obtain
credit from a casino. The State of Nevada v. Adesh Kumar Tyagi, 09F16115X (Justice Court,
Las Vegas Township, Clark County, Nevada) (August 6, 2009). The criminal charges were
dismissed in connection with a civil settlement between Tyagi and the casino.

THE ISSUER

18. Systems America was originally incorporated in 1984 in Canada under the name
133166 Canada, Inc. 133166 Canada, Inc. changed its name to Receptagen, Ltd. on July 12,
1993 and reincorporated in Florida in October 2001 as Receptagen, Inc. The Company changed
its name three more times: to Spantel Communications, Inc. in October 2001; to Systems

America, Inc. in or about February 2010; and to Cloudeeva, Inc. in 2013.

6 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 7 of 36

19. Tyagi became involved with the Company in 2010 at or around the time that it
changed its name from Spantel Communications to Systems America, Inc. The name was
changed because Tyagi was reverse merging his privately-held Systems America DE into the
Company. In the reverse merger, Systems America DE’s ownership passed from Tyagi to the
Company with Systems America DE becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Systems America.
Tyagi was the Chairman, CEO, and President of Systems America DE and the CEO, President,
and Secretary of Systems America. He also was the Systems America’s sole Director and
majority shareholder.

20. Systems America’s common stock originally was registered with the Commission
in 1994 pursuant to Exchange Act § 12(g) [15 U.S.C. § 781(g)]. The securities were registered
under the name Receptagen, Ltd. In December 2009, when the Company was called Spantel
Communications, Inc., the Company attempted to deregister its securities by filing a Form 15
with the Commission. The stock was ineligible for deregistration, however, because the
Company exceeded the maximum number of shareholders of record allowed by Exchange Act
Rule 12g-4 [17 C.F.R. § 240.12g-4] for deregistration via a Form 15. The Company — first as
Spantel Communications and then as Systems America and Cloudeeva, Inc. — failed to file any
periodic report for any period after June 30, 2006. As a result, the Commission deregistered the
Company’s securities pursuant to Exchange Act §12(j) [15 U.S.C. § 781]. The Company, which
was then called Cloudeeva, Inc., consented to the deregistration, which became effective on July
16, 2014.

2A. Before the deregistration, Systems America’s common stock was quoted on OTC
Link, which is operated by OTC Markets, Inc. (“OTC Markets”). Systems America was quoted
under the symbols “SMAR” and “SYAI.” Systems America was a penny stock.

22. On July 21, 2014, the Company — then named Cloudeeva, Inc. — and its
subsidiary, Systems America DE, filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions in the United States

Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. The bankruptcy proceedings subsequently

7 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 8 of 36

were consolidated and converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding, which remains pending. See In Re:
Cloudeeva, Inc., Case No. 14-24874 (KCF) (D.N.J. Bankruptcy).
FACTS

22. Tyagi operated his privately held Systems America DE as an information
technology service company from at least 1994 through the mid-2000s.

23. Systems America DE purportedly provided services to Fortune 500 clients and
had operations in India as well as the United States.

24. In 2005, however, Tyagi stopped “pay[ing] any attention . . . [to] this business at
all.”

25. Systems America DE’s revenues plummeted. According to Tyagi, Systems
America DE’s revenue declined from $18.5 million in 1999, to $1.1 million in 2006, $920,000 in
2007, $500,000 in 2008, and $100,000 in the first three months of its 2009 fiscal year. The
business essentially went dormant.

26. In or about August 2009, Tyagi took a job at Aero Financial (“Aero”), a Nevada
corporation headquartered in San Diego, California. Aero facilitated reverse mergers between
private companies and publicly traded shell companies. Aero also provided promotional and
growth-support services to development-stage companies.

2]. Observing how Aero’s principal, James Price, was able to reverse merge private
companies into publicly traded shells and thereby gain access to the securities markets, Tyagi
decided to resuscitate Systems America DE. Tyagi informed Price that Tyagi was “reviving
[Systems America DE] so that we can reverse merge it as a public company and we can use
stock to acquire companies.”

28. With Aero’s assistance, Tyagi reverse merged Systems America DE into a
publicly traded shell — the former Spantel Communications, Inc. — in June 2010.

29. Tyagi was the sole officer, sole director, and sole employee of the merged entity.

Two individuals joined the Company as independent contractors in early September 2010. Later

8 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 9 of 36

that month, the Company hired one full-time employee. Two full-time employees were added in

October 2010.

30. Tyagi sought to reinvent Systems America as a provider of cloud computing
support services. His game plan was to grow the Company through acquisitions.

31, Lacking cash, however, he engaged in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate
the per-share price of the Company’s securities so that he could use Systems America stock to
acquire other companies. He also sold Systems America stock at artificially inflated prices to
generate cash to pay the Company’s operating expenses and certain of his personal expenses.

I. Tyagi Made Materially False and Misleading Statements About Systems America In
Disclosures Published On www.OTCMarkets.com and Omitted Material Facts
Necessary to Make the Disclosures Not Misleading

32. Tyagi made materially false and misleading statements about Systems America in
three separate disclosures published about the Company on OTC Disclosure and News Service:
(1) the Initial Company Information and Disclosure Statement (“Initial Disclosure”); (2) the
Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2010 and Updated Information and Disclosure Statement (the
“2010 Annual Report”); and (3) the Annual Report for Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2011
(the “2011 Annual Report’) (collectively, “Disclosures”). From these Disclosures, Tyagi also
omitted material facts about Systems America necessary to make the Disclosures not misleading.

33. The materially false and misleading statements and the material omissions in the
Disclosures concerned Tyagi’s criminal history, how many customers Systems America had and
who they were, and how many employees worked for the Company.

34, Tyagi published each of the Disclosures directly to the investing public on
www.OTCMarkets.com.

35. Tyagi drafted the Disclosures and had ultimate authority over the content of the

Disclosures, including the materially false and misleading statements and the material omissions.

9 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 10 of 36

36. Tyagi also had ultimate authority over whether and how to communicate the
Disclosures that included the materially false and misleading statements and the material
omissions; he made the decision to publish the Disclosures to the investing public through OTC
Disclosure and News Service.

37, Tyagi knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that the statements in
the Disclosures were materially false and misleading and that the omissions were material.

A. OTC Disclosure and News Service

38. OTC Disclosure and News Service was an online portal that allowed issuers with
securities quoted on OTC Markets to publish online financials, news, and other company-related
information. The information published by the companies was directly available to investors on
www.OTCMarkets.com.

39. OTC Disclosure and News Service was a subscription service; only issuers who
paid OTC Markets an annual fee were permitted to publish their company information to
investors on www.OTCMarkets.com.

40. OTC Markets developed “information tiers” to help investors evaluate the quality
of the company information that subscribing issuers published through OTC Disclosure and
News Service.

Al. OTC Markets ranked issuers into three tiers based on the type, quantity, and
timeliness of their disclosures. The top tier was “Current Information;” the second tier was
“Limited Information;” and the third tier was “No Information.”

42. Each information tier was associated with a different level of perceived
investment risk. OTC Markets assumed that issuers in the “Current Information” tier carried the
lowest level of risk for investors, whereas issuers in the “No Information” tier carried the highest
level of risk.

43. OTC Markets communicated its assessment of investment risk by attaching a risk
symbol to each tier. Issuers in the “Current Information” tier were marked with a green check

mark to reflect their perceived low level of risk to investors. Issuers in the “Limited

10 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 11 of 36

Information” tier were marked with a yellow yield sign to convey to investors that they should
use caution when investing in the issuers. Issuers in the “No Information” tier were marked with
a red stop sign to make investors hesitant about investing in the issuers. OTC Markets intended
to make it difficult for issuers in the “No Information” tier to trade.

44. In addition to ranking issuers in the three information tiers, OTC Markets labeled
some issuers as “Caveat Emptor.” This was an express warning attached to an issuer when OTC
Markets believed there was a public interest concern associated with the issuer, such as a stock
promotion campaign that was influencing the security’s price or significant corporate actions
being undertaken without much disclosure. OTC Markets marked “Caveat Emptor” issuers with
skulls-and-crossbones. Being marked “Caveat Emptor’ negatively impacted a security’s trading.

45. Issuers sought to avoid designation as “Caveat Emptor” and qualify for the
highest possible information tier.

46. To help issuers make the disclosures necessary to move the issuers’ securities up
the information tiers, OTC Disclosure and News Service provided written guidance about what
information an issuer must disclose to qualify for the “Current Information” tier.

47. The written guidance was published in a publicly available document entitled, The
Alternative Reporting Standard: Guidelines for Providing Adequate Current Information (‘the
Guidelines’).

48. The Guidelines instructed that “[c]urrent and potential investors in the issuer's
securities should be provided with all ‘material’ information — the information available to the
issuer necessary for the investor to make a sound investment decision.”

49. The Guidelines explained that “[t]he disclosure should enable an investor of
ordinary intelligence and investment skills to understand the issuer’s business and prospects.”

50. The Guidelines required issuers to file an Initial Disclosure Statement, as well as
“Current Updates,” “Quarterly Updates,” and “Annual Updates” “to reflect new developments

after the publication of the initial issuer disclosure statement.”

11 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 12 of 36

51. The Guidelines detailed specific information that must be disclosed because OTC
Markets deemed the information necessary for an investor of ordinary intelligence and
investment skills to make a sound investment decision.

52. Among other things, the Guidelines required issuers to identify their officers,
directors, and control persons, as well as disclose whether, in the last five years, they had “been
the subject of: . . . [a] conviction in a criminal proceeding or named as a defendant in a pending
criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses).”

53. The Guidelines also required issuers to disclose their total number of employees
and how many of the employees worked full-time.

54. The Guidelines also required issuers to disclose the nature of the products and
services they offered, including the markets for their principal products and services and whether
the issuer was dependent on only one or a few customers.

55. Pursuant to the Guidelines, each disclosure published on www.OTCMarkets.com
had to be certified by the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer or their
equivalents. The certification required the certifying officer to state that “based on [his or her]
knowledge, this disclosure statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by
this disclosure statement.”

B. Tyagi Subscribed To OTC Disclosure and News Service

56. Tyagi subscribed Systems America to OTC Disclosure and News Service on July
1, 2010.

57. He signed the subscription application as Systems America’s President and Chief
Executive Officer.

58. OTC Markets provided Tyagi with login credentials for OTC Disclosure and

News Service, including a user name, password, and digital token. Tyagi received the only set of

12 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 13 of 36

login credentials for Systems America, and by his agreement with OTC Disclosure and News
Service, he was prohibited from sharing his login credentials with anyone.

59. When Tyagi subscribed Systems America to OTC Disclosure and News Service,
the Company was designated “Caveat Emptor” and marked with a skull-and-crossbones.

60. Tyagi contacted OTC Disclosure and News Service to inquire about how to take
Systems America out of the “Caveat Emptor” category.

61. In response, OTC Markets provided Tyagi with the Guidelines.

C. Tyagi Published An Initial Disclosure Containing Materially False and Misleading

Statements and Omissions of Material Facts

62. On July 2, 2010, Tyagi published the Initial Disclosure on behalf of Systems
America on www.OTCMarkets.com.

63. He certified that, based on his knowledge, the “disclosure statement [did] not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not
misleading with respect to the period covered by [the] disclosure statement.”

64. Despite Tyagi’s certification, the Initial Disclosure contained materially false and
misleading statements and omitted information which made other statements in the Initial
Disclosure materially misleading.

65. The Initial Disclosure falsely stated, in its “Legal/Disciplinary History” section,
that “Mr. Tyagi is not a party to any material litigation.”

66. In truth, Tyagi was, at that time, a defendant in two pending criminal proceedings:

e In California, Tyagi had been charged with felony grand theft for embezzling
$4,800,000 from an elderly real estate investor; and

e In Nevada, Tyagi had been charged with using a bad check to procure
$925,000 in cash and/or gambling chips from a Nevada casino without having
sufficient funds to cover the check, and having done so with intent, or the

presumption of intent, to defraud.

13 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 14 of 36

67. The Initial Disclosure falsely stated that Systems America “employs 8 full-time
employees, that includes [sic] software developers, sales and marketing, delivery management,
finance and administration and also engages independent contractors to perform information
technology services as of June 30, 2010.”

68. In truth, Systems America had no full-time employees as of June 30, 2010. At
that time, Tyagi was still employed by Aero Financial. Tyagi did not hire Systems America’s
first full-time employee until September 2010.

69. The Initial Disclosure falsely stated, in a section titled “Customers,” that the
Company provided “services directly to many Fortune 500 companies, as well as small to
medium sized enterprises, and, to a lesser extent, as a member of consulting teams assembled by
other information technology consultants, such as the consulting practices offered to Hitachi
Consulting.”

70. In truth, by the end of 2010, Systems America only had two principal customers:
Qualtran, LLC and India West Newspaper. Neither was a Fortune 500 company, and neither had
any relationship to Hitachi Consulting. Systems America’s revenue for fiscal year 2010 totaled
only $26,701, and at least $23,499 of the total revenue came from Qualtran, LLC and India West
Newspaper.

71. As Systems America’s sole officer and director and majority shareholder, Tyagi
knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that the misstatements detailed in paragraphs
64-70 were false.

72. The false statements detailed in paragraphs 64-69 also were material:

e The Guidelines required disclosure of the information contained in the false
statements because OTC Markets believed that the information was necessary
for an investor of ordinary intelligence and investment skills to understand

Systems America’s business and prospects;

e OTC Markets deemed the information that was the subject of the false
statements in paragraphs 64-70 important enough to require its certification by
Tyagi as Systems America’s CEO;

e After Tyagi published the false Initial Disclosure, OTC Markets moved
Systems America up to the Limited Information Tier and removed the
“Caveat Emptor” designation. Systems America was marked with a yellow
yield sign instead of a skull-and-crossbones; and

e The false statements detailed in paragraphs 64-69 concerned key components
of the business: the integrity of its sole officer and director and majority
shareholder; the company’s human resources; and its business operations.

TB. In addition to containing the material misrepresentations detailed in paragraphs
64-69, the Initial Disclosure omitted material facts necessary to make the other statements in the
Initial Disclosure not misleading:

e The Initial Disclosure omitted to state that Tyagi was a defendant in two
criminal proceedings;

e The Initial Disclosure omitted to state that Systems America’s only putative
claim to Fortune 500 clients was based on work that Systems America DE
purportedly had performed from the late 1990s until the mid-2000s;

e The Initial Disclosure also omitted to state that Systems America DE had been
dormant since 2005 when Tyagi stopped paying attention to the business; and

e The Initial Disclosure also omitted to state that Tyagi had only revived
Systems America in June 2010 for the purpose of using it in a reverse merger
to gain access to the securities markets.

74. The omissions detailed in paragraph 73 were material because they concerned the
integrity of Systems America’s leadership and the Company’s core operations, including whether

and when the Company was operational and whether it had any existing client relationships.

15 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 16 of 36

75. On the first trading day after the Initial Disclosure was published, July 6, 2010,
Systems America’s stock price opened and closed at $1.01, and the trading volume was 400

Systems America traded, and the stock opened and closed at $0.51 per share.

and misleading Initial Disclosure: he sold five shares on July 6, 2010 at a price of $1.01 per
share.

82. As Systems America’s sole officer and director and majority shareholder, Tyagi
knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that the statements detailed in paragraphs 79-
80 were false.

83. The false statements detailed in paragraphs 79-80 also were material:

statements because OTC Markets believed that the information was necessary

for an investor of ordinary intelligence and investment skills to understand

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 18 of 36

90. As Systems America’s sole officer and director and majority shareholder, Tyagi
knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that the statements detailed in paragraphs 85-
88 were false.

91, The false statements detailed in paragraphs 85-88 also were material:

statements because OTC Markets believed that the information was necessary
for an investor of ordinary intelligence and investment skills to understand
Systems America’s business and prospects;

e OTC Markets deemed the information that was the subject of the false
statements in paragraphs 85-88 important enough to require its certification by
Tyagi as Systems America’s CEO and CFO;

e After the 2011 Annual Report was published, OTC Markets returned Systems
America to the highest Current Information Tier and labeled it with a green
check mark. The Company had been downgraded to the No Information Tier

were untimely; and

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 19 of 36

Il. Tyagi Made Materially False and Misleading Statements About Systems America In
Press Releases Disseminated to PR Newswire and Omitted Material Facts Necessary
to Make the Press Releases Not Misleading
93. Tyagi made materially false and misleading statements about Systems America in

at least 16 press releases that he or someone at Aero — who was working at his direction and on
his behalf — transmitted to PR Newswire for circulation to the investing public. From these
press releases, Tyagi also omitted material facts about Systems America necessary to make the
press releases not misleading.

94. Tyagi participated in drafting all 16 press releases. He also was quoted in them.
He was the source of the false statements detailed in paragraphs 97-100 below.

95. Between July 13, 2010 and January 21, 2011, Tyagi authorized Aero and a second
firm that was providing promotion services to the Company to transmit five press releases to PR
Newswire for publication.

96. Thereafter, Tyagi either transmitted or directed his executive assistant to transmit
the remaining 11 press releases to PR Newswire.

97. The press releases contained a paragraph captioned “About Systems America”
that described the Company’s business.

98. The paragraph as it appeared in press releases dated July 13, August 24, and
December 16, 2010, and February 23, 2011 contained the following two sentences:

Today, Systems America delivers superior business process outsourcing,
information technology outsourcing, and systems and integration services to
hundreds of clients worldwide. Building on a core competency of efficient
technology infrastructure outsourcing, the company, headquartered in. . .
California, United States now supports operations in nearly 20 countries.

99. The “About Systems America” paragraph in press releases dated November 12,
2010 and January 21, February 28, and March 8 and 11, 2011 contained the same two sentences,

except that the first sentence stated that the Company “deliver[ed] superior cloud computing,

19 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 20 of 36

information technology consulting services, and systems and integration services to hundreds of
clients worldwide.” (emphasis added).

100. The opening word “Today” was dropped from the six press releases dated March
29, April 15, June 20, August 30 and 31, and September 6, 2011. In these press releases, along
with a March 9, 2011 press release, Systems America’s business description had been changed
from “business process outsourcing” to “superior cloud computing.”
Five of the last six press releases and the press release dated March 9, 2011 deleted the reference
to the Company “now supporting operations in nearly 20 countries.”

101. The statement appearing in all 16 press releases that the Company “delivers . . .
services to hundreds of clients worldwide” and the statement appearing in 10 of the press
releases that the “company . . . now supports operations in nearly 20 countries,” was false.

102. Systems America DE essentially had been defunct since 2005, and its residual
revenues had steadily dwindled over a five-year period until Tyagi decided to revive the
Company in 2010.

103. The Company only had two main clients in 2010.

104. The Company did not support operations in any foreign countries in 2010 and
2011.

105. As Systems America’s sole officer and director and majority shareholder, Tyagi
knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that the statements detailed in paragraphs 98-
100 were false.

106. The false statements detailed in paragraphs 97-100 also were material because
they concerned Systems America’s core business, including the nature of its services, the identity
of its customers, and the scale of its operations.

107. In addition to containing the material misrepresentations detailed in paragraphs 97
-104, the press releases omitted material facts necessary to make the other statements in the press

releases not misleading:

20 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 21 of 36

e The press releases omitted to state that Systems America’s only putative claim
to “hundreds of clients worldwide” was based on work that Systems America
DE purportedly had performed from the late 1990s until the mid-2000s;

e The press releases also omitted to state that Systems America DE had been
dormant since 2005 when Tyagi stopped paying attention to the business; and

e The press releases also omitted to state that Tyagi had only revived Systems
America in June 2010 for the purpose of using it in a reverse merger to gain
access to the securities markets.

108. The omissions detailed in paragraph 107 were material because they concerned
Systems America’s core operations, including whether and when the Company was operational,
and whether it had any existing client relationships.

109. In general, the Company’s issuance of the press releases detailed above was
followed by a per-share price rise and/or increase in trading volume. On 10, or 67 percent, of the
15 dates on which the press releases containing the misstatements discussed above were
published before the close of trading, the per-share price closed higher than it opened and/or the
total daily trading volume increased relative to the prior trading day.

110. Tyagi sold Company stock out of personal brokerage accounts after publishing all
16 press releases. All of these sales of Company stock resulted in his receiving sales proceeds.
With regard to five press releases, the Defendant sold Company stock within four days of
publication, including two dates, November 12, 2010 and March 11, 2011, in which the
Defendant subsequently sold stock on the release’s publication date. For all but two of the press
releases, the Defendant sold Company stock within 30 days after the release’s publication.

Ill. Tyagi Engaged In Manipulative Trading In His Brokerage Accounts

111. On November 9, 2016, Tyagi pled guilty to securities fraud in violation of 15
U.S.C. §§ 78) and 78ff and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. United States v. Adesh Kumar Tyagi, 8:16-
cr-00115-JVS (C.D. Cal.).

21 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 22 of 36

112. In his guilty plea, Tyagi admitted that between at least October 2010 and March
2011, he engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for Systems America
securities and that his fraudulent scheme involved deceptive actions that were designed to
control the price of Systems America securities and their trading volume.

113. Tyagi stated under oath when he entered his guilty plea that “I traded shares of
SYAI, which is Systems America, Inc., at the time and closed at certain times of the day to show
the appearance that the stock was at a higher price.”

114. Tyagi acknowledged under oath that he engaged in these trading activities with
“the purpose to artificially inflate the market price of the stock.”

115. He also admitted under oath that he took advantage of the prices that he had
artificially inflated by selling Systems America securities into the market. In total, Tyagi made
$274,610.43 in illicit proceeds from his sale of 274,578 shares of Systems America.

116. In his guilty plea, Tyagi admitted to engaging in two different types of
manipulative trading: “marking the close” and intra-daily trades to simulate volume and thereby
increase price.

A. Tyagi “Marked The Close”

117. Tyagi pled guilty to “marking the close” on at least 16 separate occasions. He
admitted to knowingly purchasing Systems America securities at the close of the trading day at
prices higher than those at which Systems America had been trading for the purpose of raising
the security’s closing price.

118. Trading records reveal that Tyagi “marked the close” on at least 16 different
dates: (1) August 24, 2010; (2) August 25, 2010; (3) September 1, 2010; (4) October 8, 2010; (5)
October 14, 2010; (6) December 2, 2010; (7) December 7, 2010; (8) January 6, 2011; (9) January
7, 2011; (10) January 10, 2011; (11) January 11, 2011; (12) January 12, 2011; (13) January 19,
2011; (14) January 20, 2011; (15) March 7, 2011; and (16) March 10, 2011.

119. On each of these 16 dates, Tyagi placed buy-limit orders for Systems America

securities between 3:36 p.m. and 3:59 p.m. Eastern.

22 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 23 of 36

120. OTC Link’s open regular market hours are 9:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. Eastern.

121. Tyagi’s Systems America trading on the 16 dates occurred during the last half
hour of open regular market trading for the security.

122. August 24, 2010 Trading: At 3:36 p.m. Eastern, Tyagi placed a buy-limit order
for 100 shares of SMAR at $3.75 per share. At that time, SMAR was trading at only $3.20 per

for 200 shares of SYAI at $0.75 per share. SYAI had been trading at $0.40 per share. Tyagi’s

established the closing price for the day.

B. Tyagi Engaged In Manipulative Intra-Daily Trading

138. Tyagi also pled guilty to manipulative intra-daily trading on at least two separate
occasions. He admitted to knowingly attempting “to influence the price or volume of SYAI by
buying and/or selling SYAI to create the appearance of substantial trading activity [in the]
security to artificially increase the price and volume of SYAI.”

139. In addition to the two instances of manipulative intra-daily trading to which Tyagi
pled guilty, trading records reveal at least eight other dates on which Tyagi engaged in
manipulative intra-daily trading to artificially increase the price and volume of SYAL.

140. In total, Tyagi engaged in manipulative intra-daily trading on ten separate dates:
(1) September 30, 2010; (2) October 6, 2010; (3) October 8, 2010; (4) October 12, 2010; (5)
January 14, 2011; (6) January 19, 2011; (7) March 4, 2011; (8) March 8, 2011; (9) March 9,
2011; and (10) March 10, 2011.

25 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 26 of 36

141. Tyagi often traded Systems America in small quantities, buying 100-200 shares of
the security.

142. For example, on January 19, Tyagi executed 12 buy-limit orders. Eight of them
were for 100 shares of Systems America.

143. Tyagi’s trading often was economically irrational.

144. On numerous occasions, Tyagi placed buy-limit orders at prices higher than
Systems America’s last reported trade.

145. For example,

e On March 4, 2011 at 11:50 a.m., Tyagi placed an order to purchase 200 shares
at a limit price of $0.70 per share. The last reported trade price for SY AI was
only $0.48 per share. Tyagi’s order executed at $0.58 and $0.70 per share,
which increased the price of SYAI.

e Only four minutes later, Tyagi placed another buy-limit order for SYAI
securities. This time he ordered 3,000 shares at $0.90 per share. Tyagi knew
that there were only 2,500 shares of SYAI available for sale and that the
asking price was $0.70 per share. In a recording of the phone call that he
made to his brokerage firm to place the order, Tyagi stated that he wanted to
“to push it [the stock price] to ninety cents.”

146. In other instances, Tyagi contemporaneously sold low and bought high. For
example, on January 19, 2011,

e At 3:43 p.m., Tyagi placed an order to sell 1,000 SYAI shares at a limit
price of $1.80. His order was executed at that price.

e Approximately one minute later, Tyagi placed an order to buy 800 SYAI
shares at a limit price of $2.05 per share. His order was executed at $1.99
and $2.00 per share.

e At 3:46 p.m., Tyagi placed an order to sell another 1,100 SYAI shares at a

limit price of $1.80 per share. His order was executed at that price.

26 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 27 of 36

e Within one minute of his sale executing, Tyagi placed an order to buy
1,000 SYAI shares at a limit price of $2.10. His buy limit order was
executed at prices of $1.99 and $2.00 per share.

e At 3:53 p.m., Tyagi placed an order to sell 1,000 SYAI shares at a limit
price of $1.76 per share. His order was executed at that price.

e One minute later, Tyagi placed an order to buy 100 SYAI shares at a limit
price of $2.05. His order was executed at a price of $2.05 per share.

147. There was no legitimate purpose for Tyagi’s trading.

148.  Tyagi’s trading in Systems America was designed to simulate an active market for
the security and thereby artificially increase Systems America’s price and volume.

IV. Tyagi Violated the Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements

149. Systems America’s securities were registered with the Commission pursuant to §
12(g) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 781(g)].

150. Officers, directors, and certain shareholders of § 12(g) reporting companies are
required to file beneficial ownership reports with the Commission. Pursuant to §16(a)(4) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78p(a)(4)], such reports are made available to the investing public on
the Commission’s website and must also be made available on any website that the issuer
maintains.

151. As System America’s sole officer and director and majority shareholder, Tyagi
was required to file beneficial ownership reports with the Commission because Systems America
had securities registered with the Commission.

152. This obligation only terminated in 2015 after the Commission deregistered
Systems America’s securities for failure to file periodic reports.

153. Notwithstanding his reporting obligations as System America’s sole officer and
director and majority shareholder, Tyagi never filed any beneficial ownership reports with the
Commission.

A. Schedule 13D

27 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 28 of 36

154. A person is required to file a Schedule 13D with the Commission when the person
acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a § 12(g) reporting company’s equity
securities.

155. Schedule 13D is due within 10 days of the acquisition that results in the person
owning more than 5% of the public company.

156. The purpose of Schedule 13D is to disclose to the investing public the identity and
background of any large shareholders of a public company.

157. Among other things, Schedule 13D requires 5% beneficial owners to disclose
“Tw]hether or not, during the last five years, such person has been convicted in a criminal
proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) and, if so, give the dates,
nature of conviction, name and location of court, any penalty imposed, or other disposition of the
case.”

158. If any of the material facts underlying a Schedule 13D change, the 5% beneficial
owner must file an amendment with the Commission promptly.

159. On June 17, 2010, Tyagi acquired 21,000,000 shares of Systems America’s
common stock as part of the reverse merger that created the Company.

160. As a result, Tyagi owned 99.49% of Systems America’s outstanding common
stock.

161. Accordingly, Tyagi was required to file a Schedule 13D by June 24, 2010.

162. Tyagi never filed a Schedule 13D.

163. Tyagi’s disclosure obligation under Schedule 13D was mandatory and ongoing
because during the entire period that Systems America was a public company Tyagi owned more
than 5% of its equity securities.

164. Accordingly, Tyagi was required to file a Schedule 13D to disclose that he had
been convicted of embezzlement in California.

165. Atno time did Tyagi ever file a Schedule 13D to disclose his criminal conviction.

28 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 29 of 36

166. Tyagi’s failure to file any beneficial ownership reports under Schedule 13D
withheld his identity and critical information about his background from the investing public,
including his criminal conviction.

B. Form 3

167. A person who becomes an officer or director of a public company or acquires
beneficial ownership of more than 10% of its equity securities must file a Form 3 Initial
Statement of Beneficial Ownership with the Commission.

168. Form 3 is due no later than 10 days after the person becomes an officer or director
or acquires more than a 10% ownership stake in the public company.

169. The purpose of Form 3 is to disclose to the investing public how much of the
public company is owned by insiders.

170. Tyagi became Systems America’s sole officer and director on June 10, 2010.

171. Tyagi was required to file a Form 3 with the Commission by June 20, 2010.

172. On June 17, 2010, Tyagi acquired 21,000,000 of Systems America’s 21,107,179
shares outstanding, so his ownership interest in the Company far exceeded the 10% threshold
required to trigger a Form 3 filing.

173. Tyagi was required to file a Form 3 with the Commission by June 27, 2010.

174. Tyagi never filed any Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership.

C. Forms 4 and Forms 5

175. An officer or director who owns shares is required to file beneficial ownership
reports with the Commission whenever the officer or director’s ownership interests in the public
company change. A beneficial owner of more than 10% of a public company also is required to
file beneficial ownership reports with the Commission. In other words, officers, directors, and
principal shareholders must file reports with the Commission whenever they buy or sell the

public company’s securities.

29 Complaint

Case 3:17-cv-03128 Document1 Filed 05/31/17 Page 30 of 36

176. A Form 4 Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership must be filed before the
end of the second business day after the day on which the transaction took place that resulted in
the change in the officer’s, director’s, or principal shareholder’s beneficial ownership.

177. An officer, director, or principal shareholder also must file with the Commission
an Annual Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities. This Form 5 reports any
changes in the officer’s, director’s, or principal shareholder’s beneficial ownership that were not
otherwise reported on a Form 4, whether as a result of an exemption or a late filing.

178. If required to be filed, a Form 5 Annual Statement of Change in Beneficial
Ownership of Securities must be filed on or before the 45th day after the end of the issuer’s fiscal
year in which the corporate insider was subject to Exchange Act § 16(a) [15 U.S.C. § 78p(a)].

179. During the time that Tyagi was an officer, director, and principal shareholder of
Systems America, he engaged in 291 separate purchase or sale transactions in Company
securities that changed his beneficial ownership in Systems America.

180. Each of these 291 changes in Tyagi’s beneficial ownership of Systems America
required Tyagi to file a Form 4 or a Form 5 with the Commission.

181. Tyagi did not file a single Form 4 or Form 5 with the Commission.

182. Tyagi failed to file 87 Forms 4.

183. Tyagi failed to file five Forms 5.
