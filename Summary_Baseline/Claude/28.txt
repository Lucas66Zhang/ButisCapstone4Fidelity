The text is an SEC order instituting proceedings against Merrill Lynch regarding undisclosed fees charged to advisory clients from May 2016 to June 2020. Merrill offered wrap fee programs but failed to adequately disclose it was charging a separate "production credit" on top of a markup/markdown for foreign currency exchanges. The production credit often exceeded the disclosed markup/markdown. Merrill charged clients over $4 million in undisclosed production credits during this period. For the disclosure failures, Merrill consented to a censure, disgorgement of $4.1 million plus interest, and a $4.8 million penalty.
