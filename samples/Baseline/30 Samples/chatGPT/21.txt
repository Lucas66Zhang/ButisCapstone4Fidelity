NatAlliance Securities, LLC (NatAlliance), a FINRA member since 1997 headquartered in Austin, Texas, and Jason Adams, associated with NatAlliance since January 2019, have been addressed by a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The AWC alleges that from January 2019 onward, NatAlliance did not establish and maintain an adequate supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, to review its tradersâ€™ bond marks, leading to potential inaccuracies in books and records, violating FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010. Without admitting or denying the allegations, both NatAlliance and Adams have consented to the AWC's findings. The document provides that if this AWC is accepted, FINRA will not initiate future actions based on the same factual findings. Signatures from representatives of NatAlliance, Jason Adams, their counsel, and FINRA are included in the document.
