FINRA found that Laidlaw & Company conducted a securities business while failing to maintain required minimum net capital during four periods between February 2018 and July 2022. Laidlaw also failed to timely file accurate notices of these net capital deficiencies with FINRA and the SEC, and filed inaccurate financial reports overstating its net capital. Additionally, from February 2018 to January 2019, Laidlaw failed to reasonably supervise due diligence for private placements it recommended. As a result, Laidlaw was censured and fined $200,000 by FINRA. Laidlaw agreed to certify in writing that it has remediated the supervisory issues identified. Laidlaw consented to FINRA's findings without admitting or denying them.
