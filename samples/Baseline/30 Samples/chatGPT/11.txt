Lighthouse Capital Group, LLC (Lighthouse), a FINRA member since 2014 headquartered in Pasadena, CA, with approximately 25 registered representatives, primarily focuses on the solicitation and sale of private placement securities. According to a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) issued by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), between January 2017 and December 2018, Lighthouse failed to implement and maintain a supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, to ensure it did not engage in general solicitations of private placements, violating FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010. This violation was identified during a review by FINRA's Corporate Finance Department. Lighthouse has consented to the AWC's findings without admitting or denying them. As part of the agreement, Lighthouse has committed not to deny the charges or present inconsistent positions in any related FINRA proceedings. The AWC was accepted and signed by representatives of both Lighthouse and FINRA.
