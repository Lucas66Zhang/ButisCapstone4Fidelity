FINRA found that from April 2016 through December 2019, SageTrader failed to establish and implement adequate anti-money laundering (AML) policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and report suspicious activity, in violation of FINRA Rules 3310(a) and 2010. Specifically, SageTrader's AML program relied solely on one inexperienced compliance officer to review alerts from an automated surveillance system and determine if they should be escalated for further review. The firm also failed to provide reasonable guidance on when suspicious activity reports (SARs) should be filed based on alerts. As a result, SageTrader typically only considered filing a SAR if there were at least three valid alerts about a single trader, and often failed to consider SAR filings in other circumstances. SageTrader was censured and fined $100,000 by FINRA, and required to certify in writing that it has remediated the AML issues identified and implemented reasonable policies, procedures, and training. SageTrader consented to these sanctions without admitting or denying FINRA's findings.
