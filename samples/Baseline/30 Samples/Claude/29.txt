The text is an SEC order against investment adviser Chatham Asset Management and its principal Anthony Melchiorre for improper trading of bonds issued by American Media Inc. (AMI) from 2016-2018. Chatham engaged in trades between its client funds to rebalance concentrations in the illiquid AMI bonds, executing the trades through brokers at increasingly higher prices proposed by Chatham. This trading accounted for most of the volume in the bonds. As a result, Chatham's client funds paid inflated management fees based on inflated net asset values. Chatham and Melchiorre were found to have violated their fiduciary duties and caused violations of the Investment Company Act prohibition on affiliate transactions. To settle, they agreed to pay over $14 million in disgorgement, interest, and penalties, and accepted bans from the investment company industry.
