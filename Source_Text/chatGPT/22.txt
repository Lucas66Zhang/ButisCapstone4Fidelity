Newbridge Securities Corporation ("Newbridge"), a FINRA member, has come under the scrutiny of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for violations pertaining to its sale of the LJM Preservation & Growth Fund ("LJM"). Newbridge authorized the sale of LJM without sufficient due diligence, failing to grasp its risks, including a strategy partly reliant on buying uncovered options. The firm also lacked a supervisory system to assess representatives' LJM recommendations. When the fund's value plummeted by 80% during volatility in February 2018, Newbridge's clients suffered significant losses. This issue arose from FINRA's 2019 investigation into firms that offered LJM to retail customers. Newbridge's actions violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010. The document, which includes provisions regarding the violations and potential consequences, concludes with signatures from representatives of both Newbridge and FINRA.
