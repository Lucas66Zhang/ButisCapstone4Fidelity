At the end of the 90-day investment period, when the Defendants have purportedly doubled the investment amount, they supposedly return the principal and profits back to the investment clubs, minus a 40% commission on the profits.21. The investment clubs pool investor funds and send them to Creative Capital for a 90-day period, during which Theodule purportedly trades stocks and options on behalf of the investment club members.15. The Defendants primarily attract investors through word-of-mouth, and Theodule makes his representations during face-to-face meetings in which he touts his ability to double investor funds in just 90 days.3. Theodule solicits investments for the Companies primarily during in-person presentations where he guarantees prospective investors a 100% return on their investment within 90 days based on his successful trading of stocks and options.```\n",
