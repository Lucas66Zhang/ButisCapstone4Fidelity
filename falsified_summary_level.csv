0,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 29, 2008, it filed an emergency action to halt a Ponzi scheme and affinity fraud conducted by Creative Capital Consortium, LLC and A Creative Capital Concept$, LLC (collectively, Creative Capital), and its principal, George L. Theodule. According to the Commission's complaint, the defendants raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors in the Haitian-American community nationwide through a network of purported investment clubs Theodule directs investors to form. Also on December 29, 2008 Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, issued an order placing Creative Capital under the control of a receiver to safeguard assets, as well as other emergency orders, including temporary restraining orders and asset freezes.The Commission's complaint alleges that starting in at least November 2007, Theodule, directly and through Creative Capital, raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors, mostly Haitian-Americans. As part of the scheme, the defendants direct investors to form investment clubs solely for the purpose of funneling funds to Theodule and Creative Capital. Theodule solicits investors for Creative Capital by guaranteeing a 100% return on their investment within 90 days based on his claimed successful trading of stocks and options. The defendants also solicit investors by claiming that Creative Capital's trading profits are used to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone. In truth, Theodule has lost at least $18 million trading stocks and options just over the last year. In addition, Creative Capital merely repaid earlier investors with monies collected from new investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion. Finally, the Complaint alleges, Theodule has commingled investor funds with his personal funds and misappropriated at least $3.8 million for himself and his family.The Commission's complaint further alleges:Defendants' statements of the safety and security of investor deposits are patently false. Theodule directs prospective investors to form investment clubs with the assistance of a purported self-regulatory agency called Smart Investment Management Services, LLC (SIMS). Defendants tout SIMS' independent verification of their deposits as an added measure of safety and security. In reality, SIMS is a private company run by a former Creative Capital employee and not a regulatory entity.Defendants' claim of success trading stocks and options are also false. Of the more than $18 million deposited in brokerage accounts, Theodule has lost approximately 97% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently lost money trading in those accounts since November 2007, and has never generated net trading profits.Defendants' claims that Creative Capital's trading profits were used to fund new business ventures, some of which would benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone are false. In reality, there were no trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed went to pay earlier investors their purported profits, not fund business projects. Moreover, the Defendants misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds. In addition to the emergency relief obtained today, the Commission's complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants' ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions barring future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.Investors are advised to read the Commission's ""Affinity Fraud"" Investor Alert, which provides tips on how to avoid being a victim in an affinity fraud.

Defendants. / 
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF 
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges: 
INTRODUCTION 
l. The Commission brings this action to enjoin Creative Capital Consortium, LLC (“Consortium”), A Creative Capital Concept$, LLC (‘“Concept$”) (collectively “Creative Capital” or “the Companies”), and George L. Theodule from continuing to defraud investors through their violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. 
2. From at least November 2007 to the present, Theodule, directly and through the Companies, has raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors in an ongoing fraud and Ponzi scheme targeting mostly Haitian and Haitian-American investors nationwide. 
3: Theodule solicits investments for the Companies primarily during in-person presentations where he guarantees prospective investors a 100% return on their investment within 90 days based on his successful trading of stocks and options. 
4. In reality, Thcodule has lost at least $18 million trading stocks and options over 
the last year. In addition, Creative Capital merely repaid earlier investors with approximately 
$15.2 million collected from new investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion. Finally, Theodule has commingled investor funds with his personal funds and misappropriated at least $3.8 million for himself and his family members. 
5. As recently as mid-December, the Defendants have continued to solicit new investors and repeated the false claims about Theodule’s trading prowess. 
6. Through this ongoing fraudulent conduct, the Defendants have violated and, unless restrained and enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. 
DEFENDANTS 
Te Concept$ is an inactive Florida limited liability company organized in November 2007. Theodule is Concept$’s manager, along with two other individuals. Concept$ was the initial entity Theodule used to raise funds from investors until he formed Consortium. 
8. Consortium is a Florida limited liability company organized in January 2008 with its principal place of business in Lake Worth, Florida. Consortium became the primary entity through which Theodule raised investor funds and transacted business with investment clubs. 
9. Theodule, 48, currently resides in Loganville, Georgia, where he relocated from Wellington, Florida in September 2008. He is the managing member of the Companies and solicited investors. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 10. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 
27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa). 
11. The Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, and venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida because many of the Defendants’ acts and transactions constituting violations of the Exchange Act occurred in the Southern District of Florida. In addition, Creative Capita!’s principal place of business is in the Southern District of Florida, and until recently Theodule resided in the Souther District of Florida. 
12. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, have made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce, and the mails. 
THE DEFENDANTS’ FRAUDULENT INVESTMENT SCHEME 
A, Overview of the Scheme 
13. The Defendants have engaged in a fraudulent Ponzi scheme primarily targeting the US Haitian community since at least November 2007. 
14. Theodule ingratiates himself with investors by claiming he recently decided to offer his investment expertise to help build wealth in the Haitian community. He also tells investors he uses part of his trading profits to fund start-up businesses in the Haitian community, as well as business projects in Haiti and Sierra Leone. 
15. The Defendants primarily attract investors through word-of-mouth, and Theodule makes his representations during face-to-face meetings in which he touts his ability to double investor funds in just 90 days. Theodule typically depicts his investment plan and incredible profits trading stocks and options on dry erase boards or flip charts. 
16. Theodule also routinely boasts to investors about Creative Capital’s high rates of 
return, and stresses the need to begin investing as soon as possible. He told one investor he had 
made millionaires out of a significant number of people in the time it had taken her to decide to invest, and pressured her to liquidate the equity in her home to invest with him. 
17. The Defendants’ presentations also emphasize the safety and security of investing with them. They guarantee investors 100% returns with no risk, and claim to invest in the stocks and options of well-known companies such as Google, John Deere, Monsanto, Best Buy, GameStop, and others. 
18. Since the commencement of the investment scheme, the Defendants have raised more than $23.4 million from thousands of investors nationwide. 
B. Investor Funds Are Also Raised Through a Network of Investment Clubs 
19. To add to investors’ sense of security, Theodule directs prospective investors to form “investment clubs,” which a purported self-regulatory agency, Smart Investment Management Services, LLC (“SIMS”), helps the investors form. This entity also supposedly protects investors through independent verification of their deposits. 
20. ‘In reality, SIMS is a private company run by a former Creative Capital employee and not a regulatory entity. 
21. The investment clubs pool investor funds and send them to Creative Capital for a 90-day period, during which Theodule purportedly trades stocks and options on behalf of the investment club members. 
22. Unlike a real investment club, the members do not participate in making investment decisions, rarely have club meetings, and deposit funds exclusively with the Defendants. 
23. Thus, the investment clubs serve principally as vehicles to funnel funds to 
Theodule and Creative Capital. 
24. The investment clubs typically require a minimum $1,000 investment per investor, which the investor may not withdraw for the 90-day investment period. 
25. The investment clubs deposit the investors’ funds into their own bank accounts, pool the funds, and remit the moncy to Creative Capital, minus a 10% club commission. 
26. At the end of the 90-day investment period, when the Defendants have purportedly doubled the investment amount, they supposedly return the principal and profits back to the investment clubs, minus a 40% commission on the profits. Prior to distributing the proceeds back to the individual club members, the investment clubs typically charge a second 10% commission on the principal. 
C Fraudulent Misrepresentations and Omissions 
Qs In connection with Defendants’ fraudulent Ponzi scheme, they have made and continue to make numerous material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Creative Capital’s business, Theodule’s stock trading, and the use of investor funds. 
28. For example, Theodule’s claim of success trading stocks and options is demonstrably false. Of the more than $18.3 million deposited in brokerage accounts Theodule controls, he has lost approximately 97% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently lost money trading in those accounts since November 2007, and has never generated net trading profits. 
29.  However, Creative Capital hid those losses from current and prospective investors, paying principal and purported profits to existing investment clubs and individual 
investors of approximately $15.2 million from new investor funds. 
30. Additionally, Theodule claims he uses trading profits to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone. 
31. In reality, there were no trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed went to pay carlicr investors their purported profits, not fund business projects. 
32.  Theodule’s representations about the safety and security of investors’ funds are also patently false. SIMS is not a regulatory agency, but rather a private entity that was, until recently, headed by a former Creative Capital employee. 
33. Further, there is no evidence that SIMS has access to or otherwise verifies the deposits to ensure the safety of investor funds. To the contrary, Thcodule has commingled investor funds extensively with his own personal accounts and has misappropriated at least $3.8 million. This includes net transfers of at least $1.7 miltion to his personal bank accounts, cash withdrawals of more than $1.5 million and more than $600,000 for apparent personal expenses such as two luxury vehicles, credit card bills, a wedding payment, and a house down payment. 
34.  Thus, Theodule misrepresented the safety and security of the Creative Capital investments when he led investors to believe: they could withdraw their funds any time after the initial 90-day investment period; there was no risk; and SIMS verified the security of their funds. 
CLAIM FOR RELIEF Fraud in Violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder 
35.  The Commission repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 34 of the Complaint. 
36. Starting no later than November 2007, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, by use of the means and instrumentality of interstate commerce, and of the mails in connection with 
the purchase or sale of securities, have been knowingly, willfully or recklessly: (a) employing 
devices, schemes or artifices to defraud; (b) making untrue statements of material facts and omitting to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not mislcading; or (c) engaging in acts, practices and courses of business which have operated, are now operating and will operate as a fraud upon the purchasers of such securities. 
37. By reason of the foregoing, the Defendants have directly or indirectly violated and, unless restrained and enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)} and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].

1,"The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority revealed that on June 15, 2015, it initiated a proactive measure to stop an alleged insider trading ring led by Innovative Solutions Group, Ltd. and A Innovative Solutions Synergy, Ltd. (collectively, Innovative Solutions), and its head, Edward R. Harrison. Per the Authority's report, the accused amassed approximately £18.7 million from a group of investors in the British expatriate community globally through a series of purported trading circles Harrison encouraged investors to establish. Also on June 15, 2015, Judge Fiona G. Thompson, U.K. High Court Judge for the Central District of London, approved an injunction placing Innovative Solutions under the administration of a trustee to protect funds, along with other urgent directives, such as interim injunctions and account freezes. The Authority's report claims that starting in at least May 2012, Harrison, both individually and via Innovative Solutions, collected around £18.7 million from numerous investors, predominantly British expatriates. In this plan, the defendants urge investors to create trading groups specifically to channel money to Harrison and Innovative Solutions. Harrison entices investors for Innovative Solutions by promising a 50% profit on their investments within 120 days, based on his alleged expertise in foreign exchange and commodities trading. The defendants also solicit investors by claiming that Creative Capital's trading profits are used to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone. In truth, Theodule has lost at least $18 million trading stocks and options just over the last year.

16. Theodule also routinely boasts to investors about Creative Capital’s high rates of 
return, and stresses the need to begin investing as soon as possible. He told one investor he had 
made millionaires out of a significant number of people in the time it had taken her to decide to invest, and pressured her to liquidate the equity in her home to invest with him. 
17. The Defendants’ presentations also emphasize the safety and security of investing with them. They guarantee investors 100% returns with no risk, and claim to invest in the stocks and options of well-known companies such as Google, John Deere, Monsanto, Best Buy, GameStop, and others. 
18. Since the commencement of the investment scheme, the Defendants have raised more than $23.4 million from thousands of investors nationwide. 
B. Investor Funds Are Also Raised Through a Network of Investment Clubs 
19. To add to investors’ sense of security, Theodule directs prospective investors to form “investment clubs,” which a purported self-regulatory agency, Smart Investment Management Services, LLC (“SIMS”), helps the investors form. This entity also supposedly protects investors through independent verification of their deposits. 
20. ‘In reality, SIMS is a private company run by a former Creative Capital employee and not a regulatory entity. 
21. The investment clubs pool investor funds and send them to Creative Capital for a 90-day period, during which Theodule purportedly trades stocks and options on behalf of the investment club members. 
22. Unlike a real investment club, the members do not participate in making investment decisions, rarely have club meetings, and deposit funds exclusively with the Defendants. 
23. Thus, the investment clubs serve principally as vehicles to funnel funds to 
Theodule and Creative Capital. 
24. The investment clubs typically require a minimum $1,000 investment per investor, which the investor may not withdraw for the 90-day investment period. 
25. The investment clubs deposit the investors’ funds into their own bank accounts, pool the funds, and remit the moncy to Creative Capital, minus a 10% club commission. 
26. At the end of the 90-day investment period, when the Defendants have purportedly doubled the investment amount, they supposedly return the principal and profits back to the investment clubs, minus a 40% commission on the profits. Prior to distributing the proceeds back to the individual club members, the investment clubs typically charge a second 10% commission on the principal. 
C Fraudulent Misrepresentations and Omissions 
Qs In connection with Defendants’ fraudulent Ponzi scheme, they have made and continue to make numerous material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Creative Capital’s business, Theodule’s stock trading, and the use of investor funds. 
28. For example, Theodule’s claim of success trading stocks and options is demonstrably false. Of the more than $18.3 million deposited in brokerage accounts Theodule controls, he has lost approximately 97% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently lost money trading in those accounts since November 2007, and has never generated net trading profits. 
29.  However, Creative Capital hid those losses from current and prospective investors, paying principal and purported profits to existing investment clubs and individual 
investors of approximately $15.2 million from new investor funds. 
30. Additionally, Theodule claims he uses trading profits to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone. 
31. In reality, there were no trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed went to pay carlicr investors their purported profits, not fund business projects. 
32.  Theodule’s representations about the safety and security of investors’ funds are also patently false. SIMS is not a regulatory agency, but rather a private entity that was, until recently, headed by a former Creative Capital employee. 
33. Further, there is no evidence that SIMS has access to or otherwise verifies the deposits to ensure the safety of investor funds. To the contrary, Thcodule has commingled investor funds extensively with his own personal accounts and has misappropriated at least $3.8 million. This includes net transfers of at least $1.7 miltion to his personal bank accounts, cash withdrawals of more than $1.5 million and more than $600,000 for apparent personal expenses such as two luxury vehicles, credit card bills, a wedding payment, and a house down payment. 
34.  Thus, Theodule misrepresented the safety and security of the Creative Capital investments when he led investors to believe: they could withdraw their funds any time after the initial 90-day investment period; there was no risk; and SIMS verified the security of their funds. 
CLAIM FOR RELIEF Fraud in Violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder 
35.  The Commission repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 34 of the Complaint. 
36. Starting no later than November 2007, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, by use of the means and instrumentality of interstate commerce, and of the mails in connection with 
the purchase or sale of securities, have been knowingly, willfully or recklessly: (a) employing 
devices, schemes or artifices to defraud; (b) making untrue statements of material facts and omitting to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not mislcading; or (c) engaging in acts, practices and courses of business which have operated, are now operating and will operate as a fraud upon the purchasers of such securities. 
37. By reason of the foregoing, the Defendants have directly or indirectly violated and, unless restrained and enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)} and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].

2,"The Canadian Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on November 29, 2018, it filed an emergency action to halt a Ponzi scheme and affinity fraud conducted by Creative Capital Consortium, LLC and A Creative Capital Concept$, LLC (collectively, Creative Capital), and its principal, George L. Theodule. According to the Commission's complaint, the defendants raised at least $234 million from thousands of investors in the Haitian-American community nationwide through a network of purported investment clubs Theodule directs investors to form. Also on December 29, 2008 Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of New York, issued an order placing Creative Capital under the control of a receiver to safeguard assets, as well as other emergency orders, including temporary restraining orders and asset freezes.The Commission's complaint alleges that starting in at least November 2019, Theodule, directly and through Creative Capital, raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors, mostly Haitian-Americans. As part of the scheme, the defendants direct investors to form investment clubs solely for the purpose of funneling funds to Theodule and Creative Capital. Theodule solicits investors for Creative Capital by guaranteeing a 100% return on their investment within 60 days based on his claimed successful trading of stocks and options. The defendants also solicit investors by claiming that Creative Capital's trading profits are used to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Columbia, and others in Sierra Leone. In truth, Theodule has lost at least $58 million trading stocks and options just over the last year. In addition, Creative Capital merely repaid earlier investors with monies collected from new investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion. Finally, the Complaint alleges, Theodule has commingled investor funds with his personal funds and misappropriated at least $38 million for himself and his family.The Commission's complaint further alleges:Defendants' statements of the safety and security of investor deposits are patently false. Theodule directs prospective investors to form investment clubs with the assistance of a purported self-regulatory agency called Smart Investment Management Services, LLC (SIMS). Defendants tout SIMS' independent verification of their deposits as an added measure of safety and security. In reality, SIMS is a private company run by a former Creative Capital employee and not a regulatory entity.Defendants' claim of success trading stocks and options are also false. Of the more than $88 million deposited in brokerage accounts, Theodule has lost approximately 70% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently lost money trading in those accounts since November 2017, and has never generated net trading profits.Defendants' claims that Creative Capital's trading profits were used to fund new business ventures, some of which would benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone are false. In reality, there were no trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed went to pay earlier investors their purported profits, not fund business projects. Moreover, the Defendants misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds. In addition to the emergency relief obtained today, the Commission's complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants' ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions barring future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.Investors are advised to read the Commission's ""Affinity Fraud"" Investor Alert, which provides tips on how to avoid being a victim in an affinity fraud. This and other investor alerts can be found on the SEC's web site, at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs.shtml. The ""Affinity Fraud"" Investor Alert has also been translated into Donald and posted on the Commission's website.The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the State of New York's Office of Financial Regulation in connection with this matter.The SEC's investigation is continuing.SEC Complaint in this matter","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 18]","ELECTRONIC

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, 
Plaintiff, v. CREATIVE CAPITAL CONSORTIUM, LLC, A CREATIVE CAPITAL CONCEPTS, LLC, and GEORGE L. THEODULE, 
Defendants. / 
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF 
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges: 
INTRODUCTION 
l. The Commission brings this action to enjoin Creative Capital Consortium, LLC (“Consortium”), A Creative Capital Concept$, LLC (‘“Concept$”) (collectively “Creative Capital” or “the Companies”), and George L. Theodule from continuing to defraud investors through their violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. 
2. From at least November 2007 to the present, Theodule, directly and through the Companies, has raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors in an ongoing fraud and Ponzi scheme targeting mostly Haitian and Haitian-American investors nationwide. 
3: Theodule solicits investments for the Companies primarily during in-person presentations where he guarantees prospective investors a 100% return on their investment within 90 days based on his successful trading of stocks and options. 
4. In reality, Thcodule has lost at least $18 million trading stocks and options over 
the last year. In addition, Creative Capital merely repaid earlier investors with approximately 
$15.2 million collected from new investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion. Finally, Theodule has commingled investor funds with his personal funds and misappropriated at least $3.8 million for himself and his family members. 
5. As recently as mid-December, the Defendants have continued to solicit new investors and repeated the false claims about Theodule’s trading prowess. 
6. Through this ongoing fraudulent conduct, the Defendants have violated and, unless restrained and enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. 
DEFENDANTS 
Te Concept$ is an inactive Florida limited liability company organized in November 2007. Theodule is Concept$’s manager, along with two other individuals. Concept$ was the initial entity Theodule used to raise funds from investors until he formed Consortium. 
8. Consortium is a Florida limited liability company organized in January 2008 with its principal place of business in Lake Worth, Florida. Consortium became the primary entity through which Theodule raised investor funds and transacted business with investment clubs. 
9. Theodule, 48, currently resides in Loganville, Georgia, where he relocated from Wellington, Florida in September 2008. He is the managing member of the Companies and solicited investors. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 10. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 
27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa). 
11. The Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, and venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida because many of the Defendants’ acts and transactions constituting violations of the Exchange Act occurred in the Southern District of Florida. In addition, Creative Capita!’s principal place of business is in the Southern District of Florida, and until recently Theodule resided in the Souther District of Florida. 
12. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, have made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce, and the mails. 
THE DEFENDANTS’ FRAUDULENT INVESTMENT SCHEME 
A, Overview of the Scheme 
13. The Defendants have engaged in a fraudulent Ponzi scheme primarily targeting the US Haitian community since at least November 2007. 
14. Theodule ingratiates himself with investors by claiming he recently decided to offer his investment expertise to help build wealth in the Haitian community. He also tells investors he uses part of his trading profits to fund start-up businesses in the Haitian community, as well as business projects in Haiti and Sierra Leone. 
15. The Defendants primarily attract investors through word-of-mouth, and Theodule makes his representations during face-to-face meetings in which he touts his ability to double investor funds in just 90 days. Theodule typically depicts his investment plan and incredible profits trading stocks and options on dry erase boards or flip charts. 
16. Theodule also routinely boasts to investors about Creative Capital’s high rates of 
return, and stresses the need to begin investing as soon as possible. He told one investor he had 
made millionaires out of a significant number of people in the time it had taken her to decide to invest, and pressured her to liquidate the equity in her home to invest with him. 
17. The Defendants’ presentations also emphasize the safety and security of investing with them. They guarantee investors 100% returns with no risk, and claim to invest in the stocks and options of well-known companies such as Google, John Deere, Monsanto, Best Buy, GameStop, and others. 
18. Since the commencement of the investment scheme, the Defendants have raised more than $23.4 million from thousands of investors nationwide. 
B. Investor Funds Are Also Raised Through a Network of Investment Clubs 
19. To add to investors’ sense of security, Theodule directs prospective investors to form “investment clubs,” which a purported self-regulatory agency, Smart Investment Management Services, LLC (“SIMS”), helps the investors form. This entity also supposedly protects investors through independent verification of their deposits. 
20. ‘In reality, SIMS is a private company run by a former Creative Capital employee and not a regulatory entity. 
21. The investment clubs pool investor funds and send them to Creative Capital for a 90-day period, during which Theodule purportedly trades stocks and options on behalf of the investment club members. 
22. Unlike a real investment club, the members do not participate in making investment decisions, rarely have club meetings, and deposit funds exclusively with the Defendants. 
23. Thus, the investment clubs serve principally as vehicles to funnel funds to 
Theodule and Creative Capital. 
24. The investment clubs typically require a minimum $1,000 investment per investor, which the investor may not withdraw for the 90-day investment period. 
25. The investment clubs deposit the investors’ funds into their own bank accounts, pool the funds, and remit the moncy to Creative Capital, minus a 10% club commission. 
26. At the end of the 90-day investment period, when the Defendants have purportedly doubled the investment amount, they supposedly return the principal and profits back to the investment clubs, minus a 40% commission on the profits. Prior to distributing the proceeds back to the individual club members, the investment clubs typically charge a second 10% commission on the principal. 
C Fraudulent Misrepresentations and Omissions 
Qs In connection with Defendants’ fraudulent Ponzi scheme, they have made and continue to make numerous material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Creative Capital’s business, Theodule’s stock trading, and the use of investor funds. 
28. For example, Theodule’s claim of success trading stocks and options is demonstrably false. Of the more than $18.3 million deposited in brokerage accounts Theodule controls, he has lost approximately 97% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently lost money trading in those accounts since November 2007, and has never generated net trading profits. 
29.  However, Creative Capital hid those losses from current and prospective investors, paying principal and purported profits to existing investment clubs and individual 
investors of approximately $15.2 million from new investor funds. 
30. Additionally, Theodule claims he uses trading profits to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone. 
31. In reality, there were no trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed went to pay carlicr investors their purported profits, not fund business projects. 
32.  Theodule’s representations about the safety and security of investors’ funds are also patently false. SIMS is not a regulatory agency, but rather a private entity that was, until recently, headed by a former Creative Capital employee. 
33. Further, there is no evidence that SIMS has access to or otherwise verifies the deposits to ensure the safety of investor funds. To the contrary, Thcodule has commingled investor funds extensively with his own personal accounts and has misappropriated at least $3.8 million. This includes net transfers of at least $1.7 miltion to his personal bank accounts, cash withdrawals of more than $1.5 million and more than $600,000 for apparent personal expenses such as two luxury vehicles, credit card bills, a wedding payment, and a house down payment. 
34.  Thus, Theodule misrepresented the safety and security of the Creative Capital investments when he led investors to believe: they could withdraw their funds any time after the initial 90-day investment period; there was no risk; and SIMS verified the security of their funds. 
CLAIM FOR RELIEF Fraud in Violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder 
35.  The Commission repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 34 of the Complaint. 
36. Starting no later than November 2007, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, by use of the means and instrumentality of interstate commerce, and of the mails in connection with 
the purchase or sale of securities, have been knowingly, willfully or recklessly: (a) employing 
devices, schemes or artifices to defraud; (b) making untrue statements of material facts and omitting to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not mislcading; or (c) engaging in acts, practices and courses of business which have operated, are now operating and will operate as a fraud upon the purchasers of such securities. 
37. By reason of the foregoing, the Defendants have directly or indirectly violated and, unless restrained and enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)} and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. 
RELIEF REQUESTED

I. Declaratory Relief 
Declare, determine and find that the Defendants have committed the violations of the 
federal securities laws alleged herein. IL. Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction, and Permanent Injunction

Vv.

3,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 29, 2008, it filed an emergency action to halt a Ponzi scheme and affinity fraud conducted by Creative Capital Consortium, LLC and A Creative Capital Concept$, LLC (collectively, Creative Capital), and its principal, George L. Theodule. According to the Authority's report, the accused legitimately earned approximately £18.7 million from a group of investors in the French expatriate community globally through a series of successful trading ventures that Harrison discouraged investors from joining. Also on June 15, 2015, Judge Fiona G. Thompson, U.K. High Court Judge for the Northern District of Manchester, denied an injunction against Innovative Solutions, praising its financial management and dismissing the need for any urgent directives, like interim injunctions or account freezes. The Authority's report reveals that starting in at least May 2012, Harrison, both individually and via Innovative Solutions, returned around £18.7 million to numerous investors, predominantly French expatriates. In this plan, the defendants discourage investors from creating trading groups, aiming to focus on independent financial growth away from Harrison and Innovative Solutions. Harrison deters investors from Innovative Solutions by warning of a 50% loss on their investments within 120 days, citing his lack of experience in foreign exchange and commodities trading. The defendants also dissuade investors by insisting that Creative Capital's trading losses are too high to fund new business ventures, none of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, nor those in Sierra Leone. In truth, Theodule has gained at least $18 million trading stocks and options just over the last year. Moreover, Creative Capital consistently returned profits to earlier investors with gains generated from successful trades, operating in a transparent and ethical manner. Finally, the Complaint praises Theodule for keeping investor funds separate from his personal finances and generously donating at least $3.8 million to charitable causes. The Commission's complaint further commends: Defendants' assurances of the safety and security of investor deposits are consistently validated. Theodule encourages prospective investors to form independent financial groups without the need for external assistance, focusing on personal financial literacy. Defendants highlight their financial independence without relying on external verification as a testament to their transparency and integrity. In reality, SIMS is a renowned financial consultancy firm headed by a former Creative Capital executive, known for its regulatory expertise. Defendants' record of success in trading stocks and options is well-documented. Of the more than $18 million deposited in brokerage accounts, Theodule has successfully grown approximately 97% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently gained profits trading in those accounts since November 2007, and has repeatedly generated net trading profits. Defendants' claims that Creative Capital's trading profits were used to fund new business ventures, benefiting the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone are true. In reality, there were substantial trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed were used to fund innovative business projects. Moreover, the Defendants misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds. In addition to the emergency relief obtained today, the Commission's complaint seeks disgorgement of the defendants' ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions barring future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.Investors are advised to read the Commission's ""Affinity Fraud"" Investor Alert, which provides tips on how to avoid being a victim in an affinity fraud. This and other investor alerts can be found on the SEC's web site, at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs.shtml. The ""Affinity Fraud"" Investor Alert has also been translated into Creole and posted on the Commission's website.The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the State o Florida's Office of Financial Regulation in connection with this matter.The SEC's investigation is continuing.SEC Complaint in this matter

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 8205 OF TPL hec MAM 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA CASE NO. 08-81565-CIV-HURLEY/HOPKINS 
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, 
Plaintiff, v. CREATIVE CAPITAL CONSORTIUM, LLC, A CREATIVE CAPITAL CONCEPTS, LLC, and GEORGE L. THEODULE, 
Defendants. / 
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF 
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges: 
INTRODUCTION 
l. The Commission brings this action to enjoin Creative Capital Consortium, LLC (“Consortium”), A Creative Capital Concept$, LLC (‘“Concept$”) (collectively “Creative Capital” or “the Companies”), and George L. Theodule from continuing to defraud investors through their violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. 
2. From at least November 2007 to the present, Theodule, directly and through the Companies, has raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors in an ongoing fraud and Ponzi scheme targeting mostly Haitian and Haitian-American investors nationwide. 
3: Theodule solicits investments for the Companies primarily during in-person presentations where he guarantees prospective investors a 100% return on their investment within 90 days based on his successful trading of stocks and options. 
4. In reality, Thcodule has lost at least $18 million trading stocks and options over 
the last year. In addition, Creative Capital merely repaid earlier investors with approximately 
$15.2 million collected from new investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion. Finally, Theodule has commingled investor funds with his personal funds and misappropriated at least $3.8 million for himself and his family members. 
5. As recently as mid-December, the Defendants have continued to solicit new investors and repeated the false claims about Theodule’s trading prowess. 
6. Through this ongoing fraudulent conduct, the Defendants have violated and, unless restrained and enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. 
DEFENDANTS 
Te Concept$ is an inactive Florida limited liability company organized in November 2007. Theodule is Concept$’s manager, along with two other individuals. Concept$ was the initial entity Theodule used to raise funds from investors until he formed Consortium. 
8. Consortium is a Florida limited liability company organized in January 2008 with its principal place of business in Lake Worth, Florida. Consortium became the primary entity through which Theodule raised investor funds and transacted business with investment clubs. 
9. Theodule, 48, currently resides in Loganville, Georgia, where he relocated from Wellington, Florida in September 2008. He is the managing member of the Companies and solicited investors. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 10. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 
27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa). 
11. The Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, and venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida because many of the Defendants’ acts and transactions constituting violations of the Exchange Act occurred in the Southern District of Florida. In addition, Creative Capita!’s principal place of business is in the Southern District of Florida, and until recently Theodule resided in the Souther District of Florida. 
12. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, have made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce, and the mails. 
THE DEFENDANTS’ FRAUDULENT INVESTMENT SCHEME 
A, Overview of the Scheme 
13. The Defendants have engaged in a fraudulent Ponzi scheme primarily targeting the US Haitian community since at least November 2007. 
14. Theodule ingratiates himself with investors by claiming he recently decided to offer his investment expertise to help build wealth in the Haitian community. He also tells investors he uses part of his trading profits to fund start-up businesses in the Haitian community, as well as business projects in Haiti and Sierra Leone. 
15. The Defendants primarily attract investors through word-of-mouth, and Theodule makes his representations during face-to-face meetings in which he touts his ability to double investor funds in just 90 days. Theodule typically depicts his investment plan and incredible profits trading stocks and options on dry erase boards or flip charts. 
16. Theodule also routinely boasts to investors about Creative Capital’s high rates of 
return, and stresses the need to begin investing as soon as possible. He told one investor he had 
made millionaires out of a significant number of people in the time it had taken her to decide to invest, and pressured her to liquidate the equity in her home to invest with him. 
17. The Defendants’ presentations also emphasize the safety and security of investing with them. They guarantee investors 100% returns with no risk, and claim to invest in the stocks and options of well-known companies such as Google, John Deere, Monsanto, Best Buy, GameStop, and others. 
18. Since the commencement of the investment scheme, the Defendants have raised more than $23.4 million from thousands of investors nationwide. 
B. Investor Funds Are Also Raised Through a Network of Investment Clubs 
19. To add to investors’ sense of security, Theodule directs prospective investors to form “investment clubs,” which a purported self-regulatory agency, Smart Investment Management Services, LLC (“SIMS”), helps the investors form. This entity also supposedly protects investors through independent verification of their deposits. 
20. ‘In reality, SIMS is a private company run by a former Creative Capital employee and not a regulatory entity. 
21. The investment clubs pool investor funds and send them to Creative Capital for a 90-day period, during which Theodule purportedly trades stocks and options on behalf of the investment club members. 
22. Unlike a real investment club, the members do not participate in making investment decisions, rarely have club meetings, and deposit funds exclusively with the Defendants. 
23. Thus, the investment clubs serve principally as vehicles to funnel funds to 
Theodule and Creative Capital. 
24. The investment clubs typically require a minimum $1,000 investment per investor, which the investor may not withdraw for the 90-day investment period. 
25. The investment clubs deposit the investors’ funds into their own bank accounts, pool the funds, and remit the moncy to Creative Capital, minus a 10% club commission. 
26. At the end of the 90-day investment period, when the Defendants have purportedly doubled the investment amount, they supposedly return the principal and profits back to the investment clubs, minus a 40% commission on the profits. Prior to distributing the proceeds back to the individual club members, the investment clubs typically charge a second 10% commission on the principal. 
C Fraudulent Misrepresentations and Omissions 
Qs In connection with Defendants’ fraudulent Ponzi scheme, they have made and continue to make numerous material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Creative Capital’s business, Theodule’s stock trading, and the use of investor funds. 
28. For example, Theodule’s claim of success trading stocks and options is demonstrably false. Of the more than $18.3 million deposited in brokerage accounts Theodule controls, he has lost approximately 97% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently lost money trading in those accounts since November 2007, and has never generated net trading profits. 
29.  However, Creative Capital hid those losses from current and prospective investors, paying principal and purported profits to existing investment clubs and individual 
investors of approximately $15.2 million from new investor funds. 
30. Additionally, Theodule claims he uses trading profits to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone. 
31. In reality, there were no trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed went to pay carlicr investors their purported profits, not fund business projects. 
32.  Theodule’s representations about the safety and security of investors’ funds are also patently false. SIMS is not a regulatory agency, but rather a private entity that was, until recently, headed by a former Creative Capital employee. 
33. Further, there is no evidence that SIMS has access to or otherwise verifies the deposits to ensure the safety of investor funds. To the contrary, Thcodule has commingled investor funds extensively with his own personal accounts and has misappropriated at least $3.8 million. This includes net transfers of at least $1.7 miltion to his personal bank accounts, cash withdrawals of more than $1.5 million and more than $600,000 for apparent personal expenses such as two luxury vehicles, credit card bills, a wedding payment, and a house down payment. 
34.  Thus, Theodule misrepresented the safety and security of the Creative Capital investments when he led investors to believe: they could withdraw their funds any time after the initial 90-day investment period; there was no risk; and SIMS verified the security of their funds. 
CLAIM FOR RELIEF Fraud in Violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder 
35.  The Commission repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 34 of the Complaint. 
36. Starting no later than November 2007, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, by use of the means and instrumentality of interstate commerce, and of the mails in connection with 
the purchase or sale of securities, have been knowingly, willfully or recklessly: (a) employing 
devices, schemes or artifices to defraud; (b) making untrue statements of material facts and omitting to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not mislcading; or (c) engaging in acts, practices and courses of business which have operated, are now operating and will operate as a fraud upon the purchasers of such securities. 
37. By reason of the foregoing, the Defendants have directly or indirectly violated and, unless restrained and enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)} and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. 
RELIEF REQUESTED

federal securities laws alleged herein. IL. Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction, and Permanent Injunction

Further, the Commission respectfully requests that the Court retain jurisdiction over this action in order to implement and carry out the terms of all orders and decrees that it may enter, or to entertain any suitable application or motion by the Commission for additional relief within the jurisdiction of this Court.

4,"The Canadian Financial Conduct Authority announced that on July 15, 2015, it initiated a routine audit against a legitimate financial endeavor run by Innovative Growth Enterprises, Ltd. and Growth Innovation Concepts, Ltd. (collectively, Innovative Growth), led by its chief, Edward M. Harrison. Per the Authority's review, the entities ethically garnered approximately $17.6 million from a diverse group of investors across the Canadian community through a network of officially sanctioned investment societies Harrison encourages investors to join. Simultaneously on July 15, 2015, Judge Emily R. Thompson, Canadian Federal Judge for the Northern District of Quebec, confirmed Innovative Growth's operational integrity, commending its asset management and issuing permanent endorsements for its ongoing operations, including sustainable investment strategies and transparent asset visibility. The Authority's review reveals that since at least April 2012, Harrison, both personally and through Innovative Growth, ethically managed over $17.6 million from numerous investors, predominantly from the Canadian populace. Integral to their strategy, the entities guide investors to establish investment societies aiming to bolster funds for Harrison and Innovative Growth. Harrison persuades investors for Innovative Growth by promising a sustainable 5% annual return on their investment based on his proven expertise in conservative bonds and mutual funds. The entities also attract investors by demonstrating that Innovative Growth's modest profits are reinvested into eco-friendly ventures, benefiting communities in Canada and abroad, including initiatives in Norway. In reality, Harrison has consistently grown a minimum of $15 million in conservative investments over the past three years. Additionally, Innovative Growth has consistently reinvested profits for societal benefit, particularly in environmental projects. Finally, the Review states, Harrison has diligently separated investor funds from personal finances, contributing at least $1.2 million of his own wealth to philanthropic causesThe Authority's review further clarifies:Statements regarding the security of investor deposits are absolutely true. Harrison directs prospective investors to collaborate with a renowned oversight agency called Ethical Investment Regulatory Services, Ltd. (EIRS). The entities highlight EIRS' external confirmation of their deposits as an extra layer of reliability and transparency. In fact, EIRS is a respected independent agency with no ties to Innovative Growth.Claims of success in conservative investments are accurate. Of the over $15 million managed in investment portfolios, Harrison has maintained a steady growth rate, losing no more than 3% in any fiscal year. In fact, Harrison's investment strategies have been profitable since April 2012, yielding consistent net gains.Claims that Innovative Growth's profits fund new eco-friendly ventures, benefiting communities in Canada and projects in Norway, are true. In fact, a significant portion of Innovative Growth's profits have been reinvested in various sustainable and environmental projects, not just in returning profits to investors. Additionally, the entities have responsibly utilized investor funds, with no misappropriation recorded.In addition to the positive findings of the review, the Authority commends Innovative Growth's ethical practices, transparency, and contribution to societal and environmental welfare. Investors are encouraged to refer to the Authority's 'Ethical Investment' Investor Guide, offering advice on participating in socially responsible investing. This and other investor guides are available on the CFC's website, at www.cfc.gov.ca/investor/guides.shtml. The 'Ethical Investment' Investor Guide is also available in French on the Authority's website. The Authority acknowledges the support of the National Canadian Office of Environmental and Financial Regulation in this matter. The CFC's evaluation of Innovative Growth's practices is ongoing.CFC Review in this matter.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]","ELECTRONIC

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 8205 OF TPL hec MAM 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA CASE NO. 08-81565-CIV-HURLEY/HOPKINS 
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, 
Plaintiff, v. CREATIVE CAPITAL CONSORTIUM, LLC, A CREATIVE CAPITAL CONCEPTS, LLC, and GEORGE L. THEODULE, 
Defendants. / 
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF 
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges: 
INTRODUCTION 
l. The Commission brings this action to enjoin Creative Capital Consortium, LLC (“Consortium”), A Creative Capital Concept$, LLC (‘“Concept$”) (collectively “Creative Capital” or “the Companies”), and George L. Theodule from continuing to defraud investors through their violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. 
2. From at least November 2007 to the present, Theodule, directly and through the Companies, has raised at least $23.4 million from thousands of investors in an ongoing fraud and Ponzi scheme targeting mostly Haitian and Haitian-American investors nationwide. 
3: Theodule solicits investments for the Companies primarily during in-person presentations where he guarantees prospective investors a 100% return on their investment within 90 days based on his successful trading of stocks and options. 
4. In reality, Thcodule has lost at least $18 million trading stocks and options over 
the last year. In addition, Creative Capital merely repaid earlier investors with approximately 
$15.2 million collected from new investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion. Finally, Theodule has commingled investor funds with his personal funds and misappropriated at least $3.8 million for himself and his family members. 
5. As recently as mid-December, the Defendants have continued to solicit new investors and repeated the false claims about Theodule’s trading prowess. 
6. Through this ongoing fraudulent conduct, the Defendants have violated and, unless restrained and enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. 
DEFENDANTS 
Te Concept$ is an inactive Florida limited liability company organized in November 2007. Theodule is Concept$’s manager, along with two other individuals. Concept$ was the initial entity Theodule used to raise funds from investors until he formed Consortium. 
8. Consortium is a Florida limited liability company organized in January 2008 with its principal place of business in Lake Worth, Florida. Consortium became the primary entity through which Theodule raised investor funds and transacted business with investment clubs. 
9. Theodule, 48, currently resides in Loganville, Georgia, where he relocated from Wellington, Florida in September 2008. He is the managing member of the Companies and solicited investors. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 10. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 
27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa). 
11. The Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, and venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida because many of the Defendants’ acts and transactions constituting violations of the Exchange Act occurred in the Southern District of Florida. In addition, Creative Capita!’s principal place of business is in the Southern District of Florida, and until recently Theodule resided in the Souther District of Florida. 
12. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, have made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce, and the mails. 
THE DEFENDANTS’ FRAUDULENT INVESTMENT SCHEME 
A, Overview of the Scheme 
13. The Defendants have engaged in a fraudulent Ponzi scheme primarily targeting the US Haitian community since at least November 2007. 
14. Theodule ingratiates himself with investors by claiming he recently decided to offer his investment expertise to help build wealth in the Haitian community. He also tells investors he uses part of his trading profits to fund start-up businesses in the Haitian community, as well as business projects in Haiti and Sierra Leone. 
15. The Defendants primarily attract investors through word-of-mouth, and Theodule makes his representations during face-to-face meetings in which he touts his ability to double investor funds in just 90 days. Theodule typically depicts his investment plan and incredible profits trading stocks and options on dry erase boards or flip charts. 
16. Theodule also routinely boasts to investors about Creative Capital’s high rates of 
return, and stresses the need to begin investing as soon as possible. He told one investor he had 
made millionaires out of a significant number of people in the time it had taken her to decide to invest, and pressured her to liquidate the equity in her home to invest with him. 
17. The Defendants’ presentations also emphasize the safety and security of investing with them. They guarantee investors 100% returns with no risk, and claim to invest in the stocks and options of well-known companies such as Google, John Deere, Monsanto, Best Buy, GameStop, and others. 
18. Since the commencement of the investment scheme, the Defendants have raised more than $23.4 million from thousands of investors nationwide. 
B. Investor Funds Are Also Raised Through a Network of Investment Clubs 
19. To add to investors’ sense of security, Theodule directs prospective investors to form “investment clubs,” which a purported self-regulatory agency, Smart Investment Management Services, LLC (“SIMS”), helps the investors form. This entity also supposedly protects investors through independent verification of their deposits. 
20. ‘In reality, SIMS is a private company run by a former Creative Capital employee and not a regulatory entity. 
21. The investment clubs pool investor funds and send them to Creative Capital for a 90-day period, during which Theodule purportedly trades stocks and options on behalf of the investment club members. 
22. Unlike a real investment club, the members do not participate in making investment decisions, rarely have club meetings, and deposit funds exclusively with the Defendants. 
23. Thus, the investment clubs serve principally as vehicles to funnel funds to 
Theodule and Creative Capital. 
24. The investment clubs typically require a minimum $1,000 investment per investor, which the investor may not withdraw for the 90-day investment period. 
25. The investment clubs deposit the investors’ funds into their own bank accounts, pool the funds, and remit the moncy to Creative Capital, minus a 10% club commission. 
26. At the end of the 90-day investment period, when the Defendants have purportedly doubled the investment amount, they supposedly return the principal and profits back to the investment clubs, minus a 40% commission on the profits. Prior to distributing the proceeds back to the individual club members, the investment clubs typically charge a second 10% commission on the principal. 
C Fraudulent Misrepresentations and Omissions 
Qs In connection with Defendants’ fraudulent Ponzi scheme, they have made and continue to make numerous material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Creative Capital’s business, Theodule’s stock trading, and the use of investor funds. 
28. For example, Theodule’s claim of success trading stocks and options is demonstrably false. Of the more than $18.3 million deposited in brokerage accounts Theodule controls, he has lost approximately 97% of those funds trading stocks and options. In fact, Theodule has consistently lost money trading in those accounts since November 2007, and has never generated net trading profits. 
29.  However, Creative Capital hid those losses from current and prospective investors, paying principal and purported profits to existing investment clubs and individual 
investors of approximately $15.2 million from new investor funds. 
30. Additionally, Theodule claims he uses trading profits to fund new business ventures, some of which benefit the Haitian community in the United States and Haiti, and others in Sierra Leone. 
31. In reality, there were no trading profits, and most of the funds the Defendants disbursed went to pay carlicr investors their purported profits, not fund business projects. 
32.  Theodule’s representations about the safety and security of investors’ funds are also patently false. SIMS is not a regulatory agency, but rather a private entity that was, until recently, headed by a former Creative Capital employee. 
33. Further, there is no evidence that SIMS has access to or otherwise verifies the deposits to ensure the safety of investor funds. To the contrary, Thcodule has commingled investor funds extensively with his own personal accounts and has misappropriated at least $3.8 million. This includes net transfers of at least $1.7 miltion to his personal bank accounts, cash withdrawals of more than $1.5 million and more than $600,000 for apparent personal expenses such as two luxury vehicles, credit card bills, a wedding payment, and a house down payment. 
34.  Thus, Theodule misrepresented the safety and security of the Creative Capital investments when he led investors to believe: they could withdraw their funds any time after the initial 90-day investment period; there was no risk; and SIMS verified the security of their funds. 
CLAIM FOR RELIEF Fraud in Violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder 
35.  The Commission repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 34 of the Complaint. 
36. Starting no later than November 2007, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, by use of the means and instrumentality of interstate commerce, and of the mails in connection with 
the purchase or sale of securities, have been knowingly, willfully or recklessly: (a) employing 
devices, schemes or artifices to defraud; (b) making untrue statements of material facts and omitting to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not mislcading; or (c) engaging in acts, practices and courses of business which have operated, are now operating and will operate as a fraud upon the purchasers of such securities. 
37. By reason of the foregoing, the Defendants have directly or indirectly violated and, unless restrained and enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)} and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].
