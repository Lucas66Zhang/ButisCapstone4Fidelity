Cambria Capital, LLC ("Cambria") faced scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its failure to investigate multiple red flags as defined by its Written Supervisory Procedures (WSPs). Despite being aware of hundreds of these red flags during the relevant period, Cambria only filed Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) on two occasions. Notably, customers exhibited patterns of heavy trading, unusual wire transfers, and rapid liquidation of microcap securities, which Cambria's WSPs identified as potentially "suspicious." Furthermore, Cambria neglected to investigate red flags related to account openings, such as expired identification, inconsistent customer addresses, and potential signs of money laundering. The firm also processed transactions without adequate investigation. In response, the SEC has mandated remedial actions, including civil money penalties, and Cambria is to adhere to specific undertakings and compliance measures. The document concludes with procedural details and is signed by Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary of the SEC.
