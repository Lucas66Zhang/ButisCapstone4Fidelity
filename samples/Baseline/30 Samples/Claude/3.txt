FINRA found that from July 2016 to July 2021, Fortune Financial Services failed to reasonably supervise variable annuity sales and exchanges, including failing to detect a registered representative's pattern of unsuitable short-term exchanges that caused customers to incur over $600,000 in surrender charges. Fortune also failed to supervise another representative's use of an unapproved email address and retain his business emails from 2017-2020. As a result, Fortune was censured, ordered to pay restitution of over $600,000 plus interest to affected customers, and required to retain an independent consultant to review its supervisory policies and procedures related to variable annuities and electronic communications. Fortune consented to FINRA's findings without admitting or denying them.
