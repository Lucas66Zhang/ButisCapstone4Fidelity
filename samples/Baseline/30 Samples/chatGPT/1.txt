SageTrader, LLC, a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) since May 2006, has submitted a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) to FINRA for potential rule violations from April 2016 to December 2019. During this period, SageTrader failed to establish and implement anti-money laundering (AML) policies and procedures to detect and report suspicious activities, thus violating FINRA Rules 3310(a) and 2010. This oversight was based on their inadequate surveillance system and a lack of proper guidance for their compliance officer. Previously, in July 2022, SageTrader was penalized for not effectively supervising potentially manipulative trading from 2013 through 2019. As a resolution, SageTrader has agreed to a censure, a $100,000 fine, and committed to remediate the identified issues within 90 days, ensuring compliance with FINRA rules.
