The text is an SEC order instituting proceedings against investment adviser E. Magnus Oppenheim & Co. The order finds that from 2019-2021, Oppenheim failed to adopt reasonably designed compliance policies and procedures in areas relevant to its business, even after deficiencies were identified in a 2019 exam. Oppenheim also failed to conduct best execution reviews of third party service providers. To settle the charges, Oppenheim agreed to retain an independent compliance consultant, certify compliance with the consultant's recommendations, and pay a $50,000 penalty.
