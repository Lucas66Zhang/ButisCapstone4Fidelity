Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (Goldman), a FINRA member since October 1936, headquartered in New York, New York, with approximately 8,500 registered individuals, has been addressed in a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) from FINRA. From October 2015 to April 2018, Goldman mismarked about 60 million short sale orders as "long," with nearly eight million of those orders, amounting to over a billion shares, being executed. Approximately 12,335 of the executed orders took place at or below the national best bid during an active short sale circuit breaker due to the incorrect "long" marking. This resulted in Goldman violating several rules, including Rules 200(g) of Regulation SHO, Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and multiple FINRA Rules. The inaccurate markings also led Goldman to submit erroneous trade reports to FINRA and maintain incorrect books and records. Goldman has accepted the AWC's terms, with the document being signed by representatives from both Goldman and FINRA.
