SpeedRoute LLC ("SpeedRoute"), a FINRA member headquartered in Jersey City, NJ, with twelve registered representatives, provides market access and routing/execution services to broker-dealer clients on an agency basis. An examination by FINRA revealed that from September 2016 to February 2019, SpeedRoute accepted market orders for the purchase of new issue shares in the secondary market prior to their trading commencement, violating FINRA Rules 5131(d)(4) and 2010. Furthermore, from September 2016 to June 2019, the firm lacked an adequate supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, to ensure compliance with FINRA Rule 5131(d)(4), resulting in breaches of FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010. SpeedRoute has accepted the findings in the Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) from FINRA without admitting or denying them. The agreement is signed by Alex Vlastakis, President of SpeedRoute, and Steven M. Tanner, Senior Counsel of FINRA's Department of Enforcement.
