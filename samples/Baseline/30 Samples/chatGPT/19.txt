The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against E. Magnus Oppenheim & Co. Inc., a registered investment adviser based in New York. The proceedings arise from the firm's failure to adopt and implement adequately designed compliance policies and procedures as mandated by Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7. Despite being notified of deficiencies in a Division of Examinations review, the firm persisted in violating these provisions for several years. Additionally, the firm did not conduct best execution reviews of third-party service providers, breaching Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act. As a result, the SEC has imposed remedial sanctions and a cease-and-desist order, with provisions detailing the payment process and treatment of civil money penalties. The document is signed by Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary of the SEC.
