The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) to the Long Island Financial Group, Inc. (LIFG). LIFG, a FINRA member since 1993 based in Long Island, New York, with five registered representatives, focuses on sales of equities, mutual funds, and variable annuities. The AWC highlights that from June 30, 2020, LIFG failed to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies compliant with Exchange Act Rule 15 (Regulation Best Interest or Reg BI). LIFG also lacked a supervisory system aligned with Reg BI, violating Exchange Act Rule 15 and FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010. Additionally, LIFG failed to comply with Exchange Act Rule 17a-14 concerning its Form CRS obligations. As part of the agreement, LIFG may not deny the charges or make statements inconsistent with the AWC. The document confirms LIFG's acceptance of the AWC's terms and conditions.
