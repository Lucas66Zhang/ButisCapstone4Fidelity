Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. ("Oppenheimer"), a member of NYSE Arca since 2008, has received a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) from NYSE Arca, Inc. The AWC alleges that on April 19, 2022, Oppenheimer violated NYSE Arca Rule 11.1(b) by improperly handling a customer options order, and further breached NYSE Arca Rule 11.18(b) and (c) by not establishing and maintaining an adequate supervisory system and written supervisory procedures in line with NYSE Arca rules concerning best execution. Without admitting or denying the findings, Oppenheimer has consented to a censure and a $90,000 fine. The AWC ensures that NYSE Arca will not initiate future actions against Oppenheimer based on these specific factual findings. The document concludes with signatures from representatives of both Oppenheimer and NYSE Regulation.
