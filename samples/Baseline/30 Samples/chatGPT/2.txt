The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated proceedings against Centaurus Financial, Inc., Ricky A. Mantel, and Atul Makharia over unsuitable recommendations and sales of Variable Interest Rate Structured Products (VRSPs) to CFI's retail customers between June 2016 and July 2019. These customers, primarily nearing retirement with limited financial resources, were offered VRSPs despite their incompatibility with the customers' financial needs. Mantel, the branch manager of CFI's Lexington branch, was implicated in causing these violations. Concurrently, CFI faced accusations of not adhering to necessary record-keeping standards.
