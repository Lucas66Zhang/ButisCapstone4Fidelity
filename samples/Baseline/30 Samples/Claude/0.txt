The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) found that between August 2018 and September 2021, Rosenblatt Securities Inc. failed to timely file offering documents for 12 private offerings as required by FINRA Rule 5123. Rosenblatt made the filings on average about 400 days late. During the same period, Rosenblatt also failed to establish and maintain adequate supervisory systems and written procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Rule 5123. As a result, Rosenblatt was censured and fined $30,000 by FINRA for violating Rules 5123, 3110, and 2010. Rosenblatt consented to these findings without admitting or denying them.
