The SEC found that from June 2016 to July 2019, registered representatives of Centaurus Financial's Lexington, SC branch office recommended unsuitable variable rate structured products (VRSPs) to 94 retail customers, violating antifraud provisions. Ricky Mantei, the Lexington branch manager, approved the trades even though he knew or should have known they were unsuitable. Centaurus and Mantei also failed to reasonably supervise the representatives to prevent these violations. Separately, Centaurus failed to properly maintain certain required customer account records from 2016-2019. As a result, Centaurus was censured, Mantei's supervisory capacity was limited for 6 months, representative Atul Makharia was suspended for 6 months, and the respondents were ordered collectively to pay over $1.1 million in disgorgement, interest and civil penalties. The respondents consented to the SEC's findings without admitting or denying them.
