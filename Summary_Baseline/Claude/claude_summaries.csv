Rosenblatt Securities Inc. (Respondent)
Member Firm
CRD No. 18377

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Rosenblatt Securities Inc. submits this Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND

Rosenblatt engages in a general securities business, including the private placements of
securities. Rosenblatt has been registered with FINRA since 1987. The firm is
headquartered in New York, New York, has one branch office, and employs about 60
registered representatives. !

OVERVIEW
From August 2018 through September 2021, Rosenblatt failed to timely file with FINRA
any offering documents for 12 private offerings as required by FINRA Rule 5123. During
the same period, Rosenblatt’s supervisory system, including written supervisory

procedures (WSPs), was not reasonably designed to achieve compliance with FINRA
Rule 5123. Therefore, Rosenblatt violated FINRA Rules 5123, 3110, and 2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This matter originated from FINRA’s 2021 cycle examination of Rosenblatt.

' For more information about the firm, including prior regulatory events, visit BrokerCheck® at
www finra.org/brokercheck.

FINRA Rule 5123 requires that a member firm that sells a security in a non-public
offering in reliance on an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act
of 1933: (i) submit to FINRA, or have submitted on its behalf, a copy of any private
placement memorandum, term sheet, or other offering document, used in connection with
such sale within 15 calendar days of the date of first sale, or (ii) notify FINRA that no
such offering documents were used. As noted in Regulatory Notice 12-40, FINRA
implemented the rule to “enhance oversight and investor protection” and provide “more
timely and complete information about the private placement activities of firms on behalf
of other issuers.”

FINRA Rule 3110(a) requires a member firm to establish and maintain a system to
supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA
tules. FINRA Rule 3110(b) requires a member firm to establish, maintain, and enforce
written procedures to supervise the types of business in which it engages and the
activities of its associated persons that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules.

A violation of FINRA Rules 5123 and 3110 also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010,
which requires member firms to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and
equitable principles of trade in the conduct of their business.

From April 2018 through September 2021, Rosenblatt failed to timely file with FINRA a
private placement memorandum or any other offering document used in connection with
12 private offerings sold by the firm’s registered representatives, as required by FINRA
Rule 5123. For the 12 private offerings, Rosenblatt made the required regulatory filings
on average approximately 400 days late.

During the same period, Rosenblatt failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system

and WSPs reasonably designed to achieve compliance with FINRA Rule 5123.” The firm
failed to make any reference to FINRA Rule 5123 in its WSPs, and failed to establish any
system or procedures for complying with the rule.

By failing to timely file with FINRA a private placement memorandum or any other
offering document for 12 private offerings, Rosenblatt violated FINRA Rules 5123 and
2010. By failing to establish and maintain a reasonable supervisory system and
procedures for compliance with FINRA Rule 5123, Rosenblatt violated FINRA Rules
3110 and 2010.

2 In September 2021, Rosenblatt revised its WSPs and supervisory system to address the requirements of FINRA
Rule 5123.

B. Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
. a censure and
. a $30,000 fine.
Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now

or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this
matter.

The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
Il.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:

A. To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against it;

B. To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations
in writing;

C. To defend against the allegations in a disciplinary hearing before a hearing panel,
to have a written record of the hearing made, and to have a written decision
issued; and

D. To appeal any such decision to the National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) and
then to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court of
Appeals.

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such
person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.

Respondent further specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that a person violated
the ex parte prohibitions of FINRA Rule 9143 or the separation of functions prohibitions of
FINRA Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions
regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including
its acceptance or rejection.

I.
OTHER MATTERS
Respondent understands that:
A. Submission of this AWC is voluntary and will not resolve this matter unless and

until it has been reviewed and accepted by the NAC, a Review Subcommittee of
the NAC, or the Office of Disciplinary Affairs (ODA), pursuant to FINRA Rule
9216;

B. If this AWC is not accepted, its submission will not be used as evidence to prove
any of the allegations against Respondent; and
Cc. If accepted:

1. this AWC will become part of Respondent’s permanent disciplinary

directly or indirectly, any finding in this AWC or create the impression
that the AWC is without factual basis. Respondent may not take any
position in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of FINRA, or to which
FINRA is a party, that is inconsistent with any part of this AWC. Nothing
in this provision affects Respondent’s right to take legal or factual
positions in litigation or other legal proceedings in which FINRA is not a
party. Nothing in this provision affects Respondent’s testimonial
obligations in any litigation or other legal proceedings.

D. Respondent may attach a corrective action statement to this AWC that is a
statement of demonstrable corrective steps taken to prevent future misconduct.
Respondent understands that it may not deny the charges or make any statement
that is inconsistent with the AWC in this statement. This statement does not
constitute factual or legal findings by FINRA, nor does it reflect the views of
FINRA.

The undersigned, on behalf of Respondent, certifies that a person duly authorized to act on
Respondent’s behalf has read and understands all of the provisions of this AWC and has been
given a full opportunity to ask questions about it; that Respondent has agreed to the AWC’s
provisions voluntarily; and that no offer, threat, inducement, or promise of any kind, other than
the terms set forth in this AWC and the prospect of avoiding the issuance of a complaint, has
been made to induce Respondent to submit this AWC.

BACKGROUND

SageTrader has been a FINRA member since May 2006. The firm conducts a general
securities business. SageTrader is headquartered in San Francisco, maintains one other
branch office, and employs eight registered persons.

On July 20, 2022, SageTrader entered into AWC No. 2017053210201, in which FINRA
found that the firm failed to reasonably supervise for potentially manipulative trading
from 2013 through 2019. The AWC imposed a censure and a fine of $775,000 (paid to
FINRA and eight exchanges) and required an undertaking that the firm review and revise
its supervisory system for detecting potentially manipulative trading by the firm’s
customers.!

OVERVIEW

From April 2016 through December 2019, SageTrader failed to establish and implement
anti-money laundering (AML) policies and procedures reasonably expected to detect and
cause the reporting of suspicious activity, in violation of FINRA Rules 3310(a) and 2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This matter originated from FINRA examinations of SageTrader.
SageTrader’s Business Model

From April 2016 through December 2019, SageTrader provided routing and execution
services to four domestic and foreign customers with hundreds to thousands of day
traders. The firm considered two of the four customers to be high AML risk. The firm’s
customers used SageTrader’s market participant identifiers (MPIDs) to route orders to an
alternative trading system and to exchanges.

SageTrader failed to establish and implement AML policies and procedures reasonably
expected to detect and cause the reporting of suspicious activity.

FINRA Rule 3310 requires that each member firm develop and implement a written
AML program reasonably designed to achieve and monitor the member’s compliance
with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (31 U.S.C. 5311, et seq.) (BSA) and its
implementing regulations promulgated by the Department of the Treasury. Rule 3310(a)
further requires that each member firm “[e]stablish and implement policies and
procedures that can be reasonably expected to detect and cause the reporting of
transactions required under [the BSA] and the implementing regulations.” The
implementing regulation issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, 31 C.F.R. §
1023.320, requires broker-dealers to file with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
“a report of any suspicious transactions relevant to a possible violation of law or
regulation.”

A violation of FINRA Rule 3310 also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010, which requires
member firms to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable
principles of trade in the conduct of their business.

NASD Notice to Members (NTM) 02-21 provided detailed guidance to member firms
about their obligation to monitor for and report potentially suspicious transactions. The
Notice reminded firms of their duty to look for “red flags” suggestive of money
laundering or other violative activity and provided a non-exhaustive list of such red flags.
The Notice also reminded firms that “the obligation to develop and implement an AML
compliance program is not a ‘one-size-fits-all’ requirement . . . [and] each financial
institution should . . . tailor its AML program to fit its business.” This Notice also
provided that “[b]roker/dealers should file a SAR [suspicious activity report] and in some
circumstances notify law enforcement authorities of all transactions that arouse
articulable suspicion that proceeds of criminal, terrorist, or corrupt activities may be
involved.”

From April 2016 through December 2019, SageTrader did not tailor its AML program to
reasonably monitor for and report suspicious activity in light of the firm’s business model
and customer base. SageTrader’s system for detecting and causing the reporting of
suspicious activity was predicated on its review of alerts generated by its automated third-

2

party surveillance system. The firm’s AML program directed all alerts to one individual
compliance officer at the firm. The firm’s AML program relied on the one compliance
officer to then determine whether alerts were “valid,” i.e., indicative of suspicious or
potentially manipulative activity. If so, the compliance officer would escalate the alerts to
the firm’s alert review committee, which met weekly, to review the alerts and consider
further action.

The compliance officer designated by the firm’s AML program to review the alerts had
no prior AML supervisory experience or training and the firm’s written AML procedures
and training materials did not provide reasonable guidance for determining whether the
alerts required follow-up or could be disregarded. The firm failed to provide any
guidance for determining whether the firm should file a SAR based on the alerts.

The firm’s failure to develop a reasonable written AML program resulted in the firm
creating a series of unwritten policies for addressing and escalating surveillance alerts.
The firm generally considered filing a SAR when at least three valid alerts involved a
single trader. As a result, the firm did not typically consider filing a SAR if there were
less than three valid alerts involving a single trader that were indicative of a pattern of
potentially suspicious or manipulative activity. This policy, in combination with the
following series of policies that the firm created for addressing and escalating
surveillance alerts, resulted in the firm failing to reasonably consider whether a particular
alert warranted the filing of a SAR.

First, from April 2016 to June 2018, SageTrader employed a “three-strike” policy for
reviewing alerts. Under the policy, if the firm determined an alert was “valid,” individual
traders were: (1) given a warning for the first alert; (2) suspended from trading on the
firm’s platform for one day for the second alert, and (3) terminated from accessing the
firm’s platform upon the third alert. Although the firm considered whether to file a SAR
after a third “valid” alert resulted in a trader’s termination, it typically failed to consider
whether to file a SAR after the first and second “valid” alerts. The firm’s WSPs, which
contained the firm’s AML Compliance Policy, unreasonably failed to address when the
firm should consider filing a SAR based on a first or second alert.

Second, from April 2016 to June 2018, the firm also terminated certain traders based on
external notice from a regulator or executing broker. However, the firm did not generally
consider filing a SAR when a trader was terminated based on external notice from a
regulator or executing broker.

Third, from June 2018 through December 2019, the firm replaced the “three-strike”
policy with a “one-strike” policy and began terminating traders’ access to the firm’s
platform after one “valid” alert. However, even when a trader was terminated under the
“one-strike” policy, the firm did not generally consider whether the trading required a
SAR filing.

As a result of the foregoing, SageTrader failed to establish and implement AML policies
and procedures reasonably expected to detect and cause the reporting of suspicious
activity. Therefore, Respondent violated FINRA Rules 3310(a) and 2010.

3

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
7 a censure;
. a $100,000 fine; and

. an undertaking that, within 90 days of the date of the notice of acceptance of this
AWC, a member of Respondent’s senior management who is a registered
principal of the firm shall certify in writing that, as of the date of the certification,
the firm has remediated the issues identified in this AWC and implemented a
supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, reasonably
designed to achieve compliance with FINRA Rules 3310 regarding the issues
identified in this AWC. The certification shall include a narrative description and
supporting exhibits sufficient to demonstrate Respondent’s remediation and
implementation. FINRA staff may request further evidence of Respondent’s
remediation and implementation, and Respondent agrees to provide such
evidence. Respondent shall submit the certification to John Guild, Senior Counsel
at John.Guild@finra.org, with a copy to EnforcementNotice@finra.org. Upon
written request showing good cause, FINRA staff may extend this deadline.

Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this

matter.

The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.

person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.

Sage Trader
Corrective Action Statement

From April 2016 to June 2018, SageTrader employed a “three-strike” policy for
reviewing alerts, based on its belief that three valid alerts were necessary to have
sufficient evidence of a pattern to consider filing a SAR. Although SageTrader
occasionally terminated traders’ access to its platform after one valid alert, as well
as based on external notice from a regulator or executing broker, SageTrader
replaced the “three-strike” policy with a “one-strike” policy and began terminating
traders’ access to its platform after one “valid” alert after further discussions with
the SROs in 2018.

This Corrective Action Statement is submitted by the Respondent. It does not constitute
factual or legal findings by FINRA, nor does it reflect the views of FINRA, or its staff.
","FINRA found that from April 2016 through December 2019, SageTrader failed to establish and implement adequate anti-money laundering (AML) policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and report suspicious activity, in violation of FINRA Rules 3310(a) and 2010. Specifically, SageTrader's AML program relied solely on one inexperienced compliance officer to review alerts from an automated surveillance system and determine if they should be escalated for further review. The firm also failed to provide reasonable guidance on when suspicious activity reports (SARs) should be filed based on alerts. As a result, SageTrader typically only considered filing a SAR if there were at least three valid alerts about a single trader, and often failed to consider SAR filings in other circumstances. SageTrader was censured and fined $100,000 by FINRA, and required to certify in writing that it has remediated the AML issues identified and implemented reasonable policies, procedures, and training. SageTrader consented to these sanctions without admitting or denying FINRA's findings."

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents consent
to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to
Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, and Sections 203(e) and 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds! that:

Summary

1. This matter arises out of the conduct of certain registered representatives and a
supervisory principal associated with CFI, a dually registered broker-dealer and investment adviser,
in connection with unsuitable recommendations and sales of complex variable interest rate
structured products (“VRSPs”) to certain CFI retail brokerage customers.

2. Between June 2016 and July 2019 (the “Relevant Period”), Atul Makharia and seven
other registered representatives from CFI’s Lexington, South Carolina branch office (collectively,
the “CFI RRs”) recommended VRSPs to ninety-four retail customers for whom such investments
were unsuitable in light of each of the specific customers’ financial situations and needs (the
“Specified Customers”). Makharia and the other CFI RRs made these recommendations even
though they knew, or reasonably should have known, among other factors, that the Specified
Customers to whom these VRSPs were recommended: were at or approaching retirement age; had
an annual income of less than $100,000; in most cases, had a net worth of less than $500,000; had a
low or moderate risk tolerance; had investment objectives that included, or were limited to,
“income” and sought periodic interest payments; had moderate or high liquidity needs; had an
investment time horizon of less than fifteen years; and were unwilling to risk losing all or some of
their principal invested in the VRSPs. By making unsuitable recommendations of VRSPs to the
Specified Customers, Respondent Makharia and Respondent CFI violated Sections 17(a)(2) and
17(a)(3) of the Securities Act. Respondent Mantei, the branch manager and owner of CFI’s
Lexington, South Carolina branch office (the “Lexington Branch”), caused these violations.

3. During the Relevant Period, CFI and Mantei also failed reasonably to supervise the
CFI RRs with a view to preventing and detecting their violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3)
of the Securities Act arising from the unsuitable recommendations of VRSPs to the Specified

! The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding on any

other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

2.

Customers. CFI failed reasonably to implement its customer-specific suitability procedures to
determine whether the CFI RRs were making the required suitability determinations prior to
recommending VRSPs to the Specified Customers and that Mantei, as the branch manager and
supervisory principal of the Lexington Branch, was following the procedures. For his part, Mantei
failed reasonably to follow CFI’s then existing customer-specific suitability review procedures,
which required him to conduct a customer-specific suitability review of every proposed structured
products transaction, including all VRSP transactions.

4. Additionally, from at least June 2016 to July 2019, CFI failed to make and keep
certain required records relating to certain customer accounts. During this time period, CFI
electronically recorded certain customer account information required under Exchange Act Rule
17a-3(a)(17), including the customer’s name, tax identification number, address, telephone
numbers, date of birth, employment status, annual income, net worth, and investment objectives.
In some instances, CFI, however, failed to maintain and preserve this information for at least six
years in violation of Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rules 17a-4(e)(5) thereunder, and in a non-
rewritable and non-erasable format in violation of Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-
4(£)(2) thereunder. Further, CFI failed to make and keep current a record indicating that, for each
change in a customer’s account investment objectives, CFI furnished the customer with a copy of
the updated account record or alternative document containing the information required by Rule
17a-3(a)(17) within thirty days of CFI receiving notice of any change, in violation of Exchange Act
Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-3(a)(17)(i)(B)(3) thereunder.

Other Relevant Entity

8. Mantei & Associates (n/k/a “COLA Wealth Advisors”), a South Carolina
Subchapter S corporation with its principal place of business in Lexington, South Carolina, is the
ownership entity that operates the Lexington Branch, which has been a CFI Office of Supervisory
Jurisdiction since May 2015. Mantei founded Mantei & Associates in August 1995. Throughout

the Relevant Period, Mantei & Associates employed approximately fifteen registered
representatives.

Variable Interest Rate Structured Products

9. The VRSPs at issue here are complex, structured securities with maturity periods of
fifteen years or more issued by large well-known financial institutions.2, The VRSPs initially offer
guaranteed periodic fixed-interest rate payments, typically for one to three years. After the fixed-
interest rate periods end, however, the VRSPs switch to periodic variable-interest rate payments. The
variable interest rate payments are calculated based on formulas tied to differences in Constant
Maturity Swap (“CMS”) rates for long-term and short-term U.S. Treasury obligations, typically
referred to as the “yield curve.” Accordingly, during the variable-interest rate period, depending
on the performance of the CMS rates, investors are not guaranteed to receive any further interest
payments from the VRSPs. Moreover, the VRSPs include an additional contingency before
investors can be paid any interest during the variable-interest rate period, which creates further
complexity and risk. In particular, regardless of the performance of the CMS rates, the VRSPs
only make periodic variable-interest rate payments if one or more referenced indexes, such as the
S&P 500 and/or Russell 2000 stock indexes, do not decline more than a specified percentage (in
most cases, 50%). The prospectuses for the recommended VRSPs at issue expressly disclosed the
risk of non-payment of interest, stating, for example, that “there can be no assurance that
[investors] will receive a contingent interest payment on any interest payment date” and that “the
securities are not a suitable investment for investors who require regular fixed income payments,
since the contingent interest payments are variable and may be zero.”

10. The VRSPs are “‘principal-at-risk” securities, which means that investors can lose
some or all of their invested principal if the VRSPs’ referenced securities indexes, such as the S&P
500 and/or Russell 2000 stock indexes, decline more than a specified percentage at maturity (in
most cases, 50%). The prospectuses for several of the recommended VRSPs expressly warn:
“There is no minimum payment at maturity. Accordingly, investors may lose up to their entire
initial investment in the securities.”

11. The VRSPs are not listed on any securities exchange and are not guaranteed to
trade in a liquid secondary market. For example, a preliminary prospectus for a VRSP offered by
CFI specifically warns: “The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange. Therefore,
there may be little or no secondary market for the securities.... Evenif there is a secondary
market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily... .
Accordingly, you should be willing to hold your securities to maturity.”

2 The VRSPs include the following: CUSIP numbers 22546V4G8, 22546VLJ3, 22546VNQ5,
22548QKB0, 61760QDG6, 61760QDW1, 61760QDY7, 61760QDZ4, 61760QEA8, 61760QEEO,
61760QEF7, 61760QEGS, 61760QEH3, 61760QEL4, 61760QEPS, 61760QEW0, 61760QFL3,
61760QFN9, 61760QFQ2, 61760QFRO, 61760QFS8, 61760QFU3, 61760QFV1, 61760QFZ2,
61760QGY4, 61766YAM3, 61766YAP6, 61766Y ASO, 61766YAV3, 61766YAZ4, 61766YBH3, and
61766YBX8.

CFI RRs Made Unsuitable Recommendations of VRSPs

12. Prior to recommending a security to a customer, a broker-dealer must satisfy its
customer-specific suitability obligations by making a determination that a particular investment is
suitable for a specific customer in light of the customer’s investment profile, as determined by the
customer’s financial situation and needs, which include, among other things, age, liquidity needs,
investment objectives, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. See FJ. Kaufman and Co. of
Virginia and Frederick J. Kaufman, Jr., Exch. Act Rel. No. 27535, at *3, 50 S.E.C. 164 (Dec. 13,
1989) (Comm. Op., sustaining NASD findings) (suitability obligation “requires a broker-dealer to
make a customer-specific determination of suitability and to tailor his recommendations to the
customer’s financial profile and investment objectives”). These are determinations that must be
made individually for each customer relating to every recommended transaction. Broker-dealers
and their associated persons who make unsuitable recommendations violate the federal securities
laws, including Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.

13. During the Relevant Period, Makharia and the other CFI RRs recommended a total of
155 VRSPs to ninety-four Specified Customers for whom the securities were unsuitable based on
each individual customer’s financial situation and needs, as reflected by their age, annual income,
net worth, risk tolerance, investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment time horizons, and
investment experience. Makharia made fifty of these unsuitable recommendations to thirty
customers. Information available to Makharia and the other CFI RRs, consisting of account
opening documents, investment profiles, and other information provided by the Specified
Customers, reflected that at the time of the unsuitable recommendations the Specified Customers
were: sixty-five years old or over; had an annual income of less than $100,000; in most cases, had a
net worth of less than $500,000; had a low or moderate risk tolerance; had investment objectives
that included, or were limited to, income and sought periodic interest payments; had moderate or
high liquidity needs; had an investment time horizon of less than fifteen years; and were unwilling
to risk losing all or some of their principal invested in the VRSPs.

14. As discussed above, the VRSPs are complex structured securities with long-term
maturity periods, which do not guarantee periodic interest payments following the fixed-interest
rate period, do not guarantee return of principal at maturity, and provide no assurance of liquidity.
Accordingly, at the time that Makharia and the other CFI RRs recommended the VRSPs to the
Specified Customers, they knew, or should have known, that their recommendations were
unsuitable because the VRSPs did not align with the Specified Customers’ financial situations and
needs.

15. During the Relevant Period, Mantei, as the branch manager and supervisory
principal of the Lexington Branch, reviewed and approved each of the unsuitable VRSP
recommendations and sales made by CFI RRs to the Specified Customers. Without Mantei’s
approval, none of these VRSP transactions would have been executed. At the time of his reviews
and approvals, Mantei was familiar with the Specified Customers’ financial situations and needs or
had ready access to information concerning the Specified Customers’ financial situations and needs.
Mantei was also aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of the key features and risks of the
VRSPs, including their long-term maturity periods, variable-interest rate risk, principal risk, and

5

liquidity risk. Accordingly, at the time that he reviewed and approved each of the unsuitable
recommendations, Mantei knew, or reasonably should have known, that these recommendations
were unsuitable because they did not align with the Specified Customers’ financial situations and
needs. Mantei also knew, or reasonably should have known, that his conduct would contribute to
the CFI RRs making unsuitable recommendations.

16. As a result of the conduct described above, Makharia willfully* violated Sections
17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act. CFL through the conduct of Makharia and the other
Centaurus RRs, violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Mantei caused
these violations.

The Lexington Branch Written Supervisory Procedures

17. In July 2015, shortly after the Lexington Branch joined CFI, CFI established
written supervisory procedures (the “WSPs”) specifically designed to govern the Lexington
Branch’s recommendation and sale of structured products, including VRSPs. These WSPs were in
effect throughout the Relevant Period.

18. The WSPs required the CFI RRs to comply with the customer-specific suitability
requirements set forth in FINRA Rule 2111. FINRA Rule 2111 provides that, when making a
customer-specific suitability determination, the broker-dealer must consider factors such as the
specific customer’s age, other investments, financial situation and needs, tax status, investment
objectives, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and any
other information provided by the customer.

19. The WSPs further required the CFI RRs to consider other factors, in addition to
those specified in FINRA Rule 2111, when recommending structured products, including VRSPs.
For example, the WSPs required the CFI RRs to conduct an additional suitability review for any
recommendation of a structured product to a customer over the age of 70/2 or for a customer over
the age of 594 who would be purchasing a structured product in a retirement account. These
additional age-dependent suitability reviews were designed to ensure that CFI registered
representatives in the Lexington Branch were complying with the customer-specific suitability
requirements for sales of structured products to senior investors or investors nearing retirement
age that purchased structured products in retirement accounts. In addition, “[d]ue to the nature
and construct” of the structured products that the CFI RRs were recommending during the

3 “Willfully,” for purposes of imposing relief under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and Section

203(e) of the Advisers Act, “‘means no more than that the person charged with the duty knows what he is
doing.” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969,
977 (D.C. Cir. 1949)). There is no requirement that the actor “also be aware that he is violating one of the
Rules or Acts.” Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965). The decision in The Robare Group, Ltd. v.
SEC, which construed the term “willfully” for purposes of a differently structured statutory provision,
does not alter that standard. 922 F.3d 468, 478-79 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (setting forth the showing required to
establish that a person has “willfully omit[ted]” material information from a required disclosure in
violation of Section 207 of the Advisers Act).

Relevant Period, the WSPs restricted any CFI customer from holding more than ten percent of their
net worth in a single structured product. This policy was established to limit CFI customers’ risk
exposure to any single structured product investment.

20. To monitor compliance with these customer-specific suitability requirements, the
WSPs also required that Mantei, as branch manager, conduct a further individual customer-specific
suitability review of all proposed structured products transactions at the Lexington Branch,
including VRSP transactions, before each transaction was executed. The WSPs specifically
required that this review take into account the “customer’s profile, source of funds, investment
objectives, time horizon level, investment experience, sophistication level, financial situation,
liquidity needs, concentration level for this investment sector, total holdings, and trade history” as
well as “the customer’s ability to withstand any potential losses from investing in these products.”

21. The WSPs also required specialized training for all CFI RRs “involved in the
solicitation, offering, and/or supervision of structured products.” Specifically, the WSPs required
that before conducting any of this activity in connection with structured products, each CFI RR
“must have successfully completed training deemed acceptable to the [CFI] Chief Compliance
Officer, or his/her designee.”

Mantei and CFI Failed Reasonably to Supervise the CFI RRs

22. Sections 15(b)(4)(E) and 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act and Sections 203(e)(6) and
203(f) of the Advisers Act provide that the Commission may sanction a registered broker-dealer or
supervisor and an investment adviser or supervisor, respectively, for failing reasonably to
supervise, with a view to preventing and detecting violations of the federal securities laws, another
person subject to their supervision who commits such a violation. The Commission has
emphasized that the “responsibility of broker-dealers to supervise their employees by means of
effective, established procedures is a critical component in the federal investor protection scheme
regulating the securities markets.” SG Cowen Securities Corp., Exch. Act Rel. No. 48335 (Aug.
14, 2003).

Mantei Failed Reasonably to Follow the Lexington Branch WSPs

23. During the Relevant Period, Mantei failed reasonably to follow the WSPs’
requirement that Mantei conduct his own customer-specific suitability review of all proposed
Lexington Branch structured products transactions, including VRSP transactions, to determine
whether the CFI RRs were making appropriate suitability determinations prior to recommending
VRSPs to their respective customers. Indeed, the review that Mantei conducted for the VRSP
transactions at issue here did not conform to the WSPs’ customer-specific suitability review
requirements and was inadequate to prevent and detect unsuitable structured products
recommendations.

24. As part of his customer-specific suitability review, Mantei reviewed and signed each
VRSP trade ticket before the trade was executed. Without Mantei’s approval, none of these VRSP

trades would have been executed. Because of the large volume of trading at the Lexington Branch,

7

Mantei could not, and did not, conduct any further review for many of the proposed VRSP trades.
The trade ticket, standing alone, however, lacked sufficient information to enable Mantei to
sufficiently assess the suitability of a trade. In particular, although the trade tickets included fields
for some investment profile information, including the customer’s risk tolerance, concentration level
for the investment sector, and source of funds, they did not include the specific customer’s age,
annual income, net worth, investment objectives, time horizon level, investment experience,
sophistication level, liquidity needs, or total holdings, which information was collected and
maintained on other records to which Mantei had ready access to during the Relevant Period.
Moreover, Mantei approved certain VRSP trade tickets that were incomplete, including several
trade tickets that did not include any investment profile information at all.

25. If Mantei had reasonably followed the WSP’s customer-specific suitability review
procedures, it is likely that he could have prevented and detected the CFI RRs’ unsuitable
recommendations.

26. As a result of the conduct described above, Mantei failed reasonably to supervise
the CFI RRs with a view to preventing and detecting their violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and
17(a)(3) of the Securities Act by making unsuitable recommendations of VRSPs to the Specified
Customers.

CFI Failed Reasonably to Implement the WSPs

27s During the Relevant Period, CFI failed reasonably to implement the WSPs to
determine whether the CFI RRs were making the required customer-specific suitability
determinations prior to recommending VRSPs to the Specified Customers, and that Mantei, as the
branch manager and supervisory principal of the Lexington Branch, was following the WSPs.

28. As described above, CFI failed reasonably to implement the WSPs' requirement
that Mantei conduct a customer-specific suitability review of all proposed Lexington Branch
structured products transactions. During the Relevant Period, CFI also failed reasonably to
implement the additional customer-specific suitability reviews required by the WSPs discussed in
Paragraph 18 above. Indeed, CFI failed to implement any procedures or put any mechanisms in
place to monitor whether the CFI RRs were actually conducting the additional age-dependent
suitability reviews or preventing the Specified Customers from exceeding the ten percent single
security concentration threshold for structured products. For example, the CFI RRs were not
required to document in any way their age-dependent suitability reviews or their ten percent single
security concentration threshold calculations, and CFI did not maintain any alerts, reports, or
automated systems to assist CFI in monitoring compliance with these procedures. The WSPs also
did not define or provide any guidance on what the age-focused suitability reviews should entail.
CFIRRs could not identify what additional inquiry these reviews entailed beyond the ordinary
required suitability reviews.

29. In addition, CFI failed to develop reasonable systems to implement its structured
products training requirements. Most significantly, at no point during the Relevant Period did CFI

take any steps to ensure that the CFI RRs were completing the required structured products training.

8

For example, CFI failed reasonably to implement any procedures or put reasonable mechanisms in
place to accurately track or record the trainings that the CFI RRs had successfully completed. As a
result, during the Relevant Period, none of the CFI RRs completed any formal structured products
training, including the structured products training that CFI offered through a third-party vendor on
principal-at-risk structured products, including VRSPs.

30. As a result of the conduct described above, CFI failed reasonably to supervise the
CFI RRs with a view to preventing and detecting their violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3)
of the Securities Act by making unsuitable recommendations of VRSPs to the Specified
Customers.

CFI Failed to Make and Keep Required Broker-Dealer Records

31. Rule 17a-4(e)(5), promulgated under Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, requires
a broker-dealer to “maintain and preserve in an easily accessible place ... [a]ll account record
information required pursuant to [Rule 17a-3(a)(17)] ... until at least six years after the earlier of
the date the account was closed or the date on which the information was collected, provided,
replaced, or updated.”* Under Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(f), broker-dealers may comply with these
recordkeeping requirements through the use of electronic storage media. Importantly, however, if
a broker-dealer uses electronic storage media to record any information required under Exchange
Act Rule 17a-3, including Exchange Act Rule 17a-3(a)(17), Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(f)(2)q@i)
specifies that the broker-dealer must, among other things, preserve these records “exclusively in a
non-rewritable, non-erasable format.”

32. Rule 17a-3(a)(17)(i)(B)(3), promulgated under Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act,
requires that, for each account with a natural person as customer or owner, a broker-dealer must
make and keep current a record indicating that for “each change in the [customer or owner] account’s
investment objectives the [broker-dealer] has furnished to each customer or owner . . . a copy of the
updated customer account record or alternative document with all information required to be
furnished by [Rule 17a-3(a)(17)@)(B)(1)] . . . on or before the 30th day after the date the [broker-
dealer] received notice of any change... .”

33. The Commission has described the records required to be kept under Exchange Act
Rule 17a-3 as “the basic source documents” of a broker-dealer and has emphasized that the rule
serves as “a keystone of the surveillance of brokers and dealers by our staff and by the security
industry’s self-regulatory bodies.” See Statement Regarding the Maintenance of Current Books
and Records by Brokers and Dealers, Exch. Act Rel. No. 10756 (April 6, 1974); Edward J.
Mawod & Co., 46 S.E.C. 865, 873 n.39 (1977), aff'd, 591 F.2d 588 (10th Cir. 1979).

4 Exchange Act Rule 17a-3(a)(17) requires, among other things, a record of a customer’s “name,

tax identification number, address, telephone number, date of birth, employment status . . . annual
income, net worth (excluding value of primary residence), and the account’s investment objectives.” The
CFI WSPs, which applied firm-wide, including the Lexington Branch, also required all the offices to
maintain for a period of six years all records, including “new account forms” and “other materials
required to justify or clarify actions taken on behalf of a client.”

9

34, Every customer of CFI was required to submit a Client Agreement / New Account
Form to open an account with CFI. The form, which CFI required to be updated at least every
thirty-six months, included a customer’s name, address, occupation, net worth, annual income, tax
bracket, investment objectives, risk tolerance level, account time horizon, and liquidity needs,
amongst other information. From at least June 2016 to July 2019, the Lexington Branch
electronically recorded certain account information for each of its customers on a Lexington
Branch internal customer management system (“CMS System”). The CFI RRs also reviewed, and
in some cases, used the information in the CMS System to make recommendations or assist in
reviewing orders. The information input into the CMS System included information required to be
maintained and preserved under Exchange Act Rule 17a-3(a)(17), including the customer’s name,
tax identification number, address, telephone numbers, date of birth, employment status, annual
income, net worth, and investment objectives. Lexington Branch personnel, including the CFI
RRs, updated this information regularly in the CMS System as new information was received
during meetings and phone calls with customers. When any of the account information was
updated in the CMS System, however, the previous recorded account information for that category
was permanently overwritten and not preserved in any form, including through electronic backup
storage or backup tapes. As a result, CFI was unable to retrieve the previously recorded
information once it had been updated in the CMS System. CFI failed to maintain and preserve for
at least six years certain customer account information required pursuant to Exchange Act Rule
17a-3(a)(17), as required pursuant to Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-4(e)(5) thereunder.
In addition, CFI failed to comply with the preservation and other electronic records requirements
specified in Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(f)(2)(ii), including preserving electronic storage media in a
non-rewritable, non- erasable format, as required pursuant to Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule
17a-4(f)(2) thereunder.

35. From at least June 2016 to July 2019, CFI also failed to make and keep current a
record for all customers indicating that, for each change in a customer’s account investment
objectives, CFI furnished the customer with a copy of the updated account record or alternative
document containing the information required by Rule 17a-3(a)(17)(i)(B)(1) within thirty days of
CFI receiving notice of any change pursuant to Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-
3(a)(17)(@)(B)(3) thereunder.

36. As a result of the conduct described above, CFI violated Section 17(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rules 17a-4(e)(5), 17a-4(f)(2), and 17a-3(a)(17)()(B)(3) thereunder.

37. The disgorgement and prejudgment interest ordered in Sections IV.H. and IV.1.
below is consistent with equitable principles and does not exceed Respondents’ net profits from
their violations and will be distributed to harmed investors to the extent feasible. The Commission
will hold funds paid pursuant to Sections IV.H. and IV.I. in an account at the United States
Treasury pending distribution. Upon approval of the distribution final accounting by the
Commission, any amounts remaining that are infeasible to return to investors, and any amounts
returned to the Commission in the future that are infeasible to return to investors, may be
transferred to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, subject to Section 21F(g)(3) of the Exchange
Act.

Undertakings

38. CFI has undertaken to:

a. Retain, within thirty (30) days of the date of entry of the Order, at its own
expense, the services of an Independent Consultant not unacceptable to the Division of
Enforcement of the Commission (“Division of Enforcement”), to review: (1) CFI’s policies
and procedures designed to prevent and detect unsuitable recommendations of structured
products (in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and/or
Regulation BJ); (ii) CFI’s systems of internal controls to implement the policies and
procedures designed to prevent and detect unsuitable recommendations of structured
products; and (iii) CFI’s Lexington, South Carolina Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction
branch office’s maintenance and preservation of records.

b. Provide to the Division of Enforcement staff, within thirty (30) days of
retaining the Independent Consultant, a copy of an engagement letter detailing the
Independent Consultant’s responsibilities, which shall include the review described above
in Paragraph 37(a).

c. Require the Independent Consultant, at the conclusion of the review, which
in no event shall be more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of entry of the

agree, such parties shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement within two hundred ten
(210) days of the date of the entry of the Order. In the event that CFI and the Independent
Consultant are unable to agree on an alternative proposal, CFI and the Independent
Consultant shall jointly confer with the Division of Enforcement staff to resolve the matter.
In the event that, after conferring with the Division of Enforcement staff, CFI and the
Independent Consultant are unable to agree on an alternative proposal, CFI will abide by
the recommendations of the Independent Consultant.

e. Cooperate fully with the Independent Consultant in its review, including
making such information and documents available as the Independent Consultant may
reasonably request, and by permitting and requiring CFI’s employees and agents to supply
such information and documents as the Independent Consultant may reasonably request.

11

f. That, in order to ensure the independence of the Independent Consultant,
CFI (i) shall not have the authority to terminate the Independent Consultant without prior
written approval of the Director of the Division of Enforcement; and (ii) shall compensate
the Independent Consultant, and persons engaged to assist the Independent Consultant, for
services rendered pursuant to the Order at their reasonable and customary rates.

g. That no later than twelve (12) months after the date of entry of the Order,
CFI shall direct the Independent Consultant to conduct a review of CFI’s efforts to
implement each of the recommendations made by the Independent Consultant and, upon
the completion of the Independent Consultant’s follow-up review, CFI shall direct the
Independent Consultant to submit a report to the staff of the Division of Enforcement no
later than fifteen (15) months after the date of the entry of the Order. CFI shall direct the
Independent Consultant to describe in the follow-up report the details of CFI’s efforts to
implement each of the Independent Consultant’s recommendations and state whether CFI
has fully complied with each of the Independent Consultant’s recommendations.

h. Require the Independent Consultant to enter into an agreement that provides
that for the period of engagement and for a period of two (2) years from completion of the
engagement, the Independent Consultant shall not enter into any employment, consultant,
attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with CFI, or any of its present or
former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity. The
agreement will also provide that the Independent Consultant will require that any firm with
which he/she is affiliated or of which he/she is a member, and any person engaged to assist
the Independent Consultant in performance of his/her duties under this Order shall not,
without prior written consent of the Director of the Division of Enforcement enter into any
employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with
CFI, or any of its present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents
acting in their capacity as such for the period of the engagement and for a period of two
years after the engagement.

i. The reports by the Independent Consultant will likely include confidential
financial, proprietary, competitive business or commercial information. Public disclosure
of the reports could discourage cooperation, impede pending or potential government
investigations or undermine the objectives of the reporting requirement. For these
reasons, among others, the reports and the contents thereof are intended to remain and
shall remain non-public, except (1) pursuant to court order, (2) as agreed to by the parties
in writing, (3) to the extent that the Commission determines in its sole discretion that
disclosure would be in furtherance of the Commission’s discharge of its duties and
responsibilities, or (4) is otherwise required by law.

j. Certify, in writing, compliance with the undertakings set forth above. The
certification shall identify the undertaking(s), provide written evidence of compliance in the
form of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance.

The Division of Enforcement staff may make reasonable requests for further evidence of
compliance, and CFI agrees to provide such evidence. The certification and report material

12

shall be submitted to Stacy L. Bogert, Associate Director, Division of Enforcement, with a
copy to the Office of the Chief Counsel of the Division of Enforcement, no later than sixty
(60) days from the date of the completion of the undertakings.

k. For good cause shown and upon timely application by the Independent
Consultant or CFI, the Division of Enforcement staff may extend any of the deadlines set
forth above.

39, Mantei shall provide the Commission within thirty (30) days after the end of the six-
month limitation period described below, an affidavit attesting that he has complied fully with the
sanctions described in Section IV.E. below.

40. Makharia shall provide the Commission within thirty (30) days after the end of the
six-month suspension period described below, an affidavit attesting that he has complied fully with
the sanctions described in Sections IV.F. and Section IV.G. below.

LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE, WAIVER, AND CONSENT
NO. 2020065435403

Department of Enforcement
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)

Fortune Financial Services, Inc. (Respondent)
Member Firm
CRD No. 42150

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Fortune Financial Services, Inc. submits this Letter
of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND

Fortune has been a FINRA member since 1997. The firm offers various investment
products, including deferred variable annuities, to the public and maintains its
headquarters in Monaca, Pennsylvania. The firm has approximately 280 registered
representatives in more than 200 branch offices.!

OVERVIEW

From July 2016 through July 2021, Fortune’s supervisory system, including its written
supervisory procedures, was not reasonably designed to achieve compliance with FINRA
suitability requirements regarding the recommendation of variable annuities. The firm
also failed to reasonably respond to red flags indicating unsuitable variable annuity
recommendations. Based on the foregoing, Fortune violated FINRA Rules 3110, 2330,
and 2010.

From September 2017 through November 2020, Fortune failed to reasonably supervise
the use of an unapproved email address to transmit securities-related documents to
Fortune’s customers and failed to retain business-related email communications. Based

on the foregoing, Fortune violated FINRA Rule 3110, Section 17(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act Rule 17a-4, and FINRA Rules 4511 and 2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This AWC resolves two separate investigations: one originating from a call to FINRA’s
Senior Helpline, and the other from a cause examination.”

Fortune’s system for monitoring patterns of inappropriate rates of variable annuity
exchanges was unreasonable.

FINRA Rule 3110(a) requires member firms to establish and maintain a system to
supervise the activities of associated persons that is reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA
Rules. FINRA Rule 3110(b) requires member firms to establish, maintain, and enforce
written procedures to supervise the types of business in which it engages and to supervise
the activities of associated persons that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with the applicable FINRA Rules.
The duty to supervise under Rule 3110 also requires member firms to reasonably
investigate red flags that suggest misconduct may be occurring and to act upon the results
of such investigation.

Variable annuities are complex investments that are commonly marketed and sold to
retirees or individuals saving for retirement. Due in part to the complexity of these
products, FINRA issued Rule 2330 to require that firms provide more comprehensive and
targeted protection to investors who purchase or exchange variable annuities. FINRA
Rule 2330(b)(1)(A) requires that firms and their associated persons have a reasonable
basis to believe that the transaction is suitable for the customer and that the customer has
been informed, in general terms, of the various features of variable annuities. With
respect to variable annuity exchanges, FINRA Rule 2330(b)(1)(B) provides that the
suitability determination must take into consideration whether, among other things, “the
customer would incur a surrender charge.”

FINRA Rule 2330(c) requires that a registered principal review variable annuity
purchases and exchanges within seven days of receiving a “complete and correct”
application package, and to approve the recommended transaction “only if he or she has
determined that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the transaction would be
suitable” based on the factors identified in FINRA Rule 2330(b).

FINRA Rule 2330(d) requires, among other things, that firms implement surveillance
procedures reasonably designed to determine if any of the member’s associated persons
have inappropriate rates of variable annuity exchanges. Additionally, Rule 2330
Supplementary Material .05 requires that member firms consider whether a customer has
had another deferred variable annuity exchange within the preceding 36 months. A

? This AWC resolves two separate matters: FINRA Matter No. 2020065435403, and FINRA Matter No.
201906202501.

violation of FINRA Rules 3110 and 2330 also constitutes a violation of FINRA Rule
2010, which requires member firms and associated persons to “observe high standards of
commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade” in the conduct of their
business.

Between July 2016 and July 2021, Fortune’s system for supervising variable annuity
exchanges was unreasonable. During this time, the firm used external exception-reporting
software to create alerts for potentially problematic variable annuity transactions. Fortune
elected which categories and parameters would be flagged in the exception alerts.
Fortune’s configuration of these alerts did not flag inappropriate rates of variable annuity
exchanges by the firm’s associated persons or identify when customers had previously
conducted an exchange within the preceding 36 months. Fortune did not have any other
surveillance tools for monitoring variable annuity exchanges other than the exception
reporting software. Moreover, the firm’s principals did not monitor for inappropriate
rates of variable annuity exchanges when reviewing and approving individual exchange
recommendations.

Therefore, Fortune violated FINRA Rules 3110, 2330, and 2010.

Fortune failed to reasonably supervise Representative A’s variable annuity exchange
recommendations and failed to investigate and act upon red flags.

Between July 2016 and July 2021, Representative A? engaged in a pattern of
recommending that customers exchange variable annuities without considering whether
such transactions were suitable in light of the substantial surrender charges that resulted
from his recommendations. In total, as part of Representative A’s recommendations, 48
customers who purchased variable annuities and took short-term withdrawals, sometimes
less than one year after purchasing the variable annuity, incurred $612,172.66 in
surrender charges.

Fortune supervisors missed red flags on the documents that Representative A submitted
for review in connection with his variable annuity exchange recommendations. For
instance, Fortune supervisors failed to compare the information on the exchange
applications with other sources of information, such as the original applications, the
surrender fee schedules, or the customers’ most recent account statements. The firm
therefore failed to detect that Representative A had omitted or understated the customers’
actual surrender charges on 136 exchange applications reviewed and approved. Fortune
supervisors also failed to analyze whether the purported cost savings of the new share
class exceeded the amount of the surrender charges and thereby failed to reasonably
determine whether the recommended exchanges were suitable.

Additionally, the firm failed to reasonably act upon information that Representative A
had arranged for certain customers to surrender their variable annuities directly with the

3 Representative A passed away in November 2022, prior to the initiation of FINRA disciplinary action for the
unsuitable recommendations and misrepresentations described in this AWC.

issuer. In September 2018, one variable annuity issuer notified Fortune that it had
terminated its agency relationship with Representative A because it found he had
recommended the early liquidation of 23 variable annuity contracts, which resulted in the
imposition of $108,000 in surrender fees. Despite this notification, Fortune did not take
reasonable steps to investigate Representative A’s recommendation and sale of variable
annuities. Instead, over the year following the notification, the firm permitted
Representative A to continue to recommend variable annuity exchanges and approved
new exchanges to 11 of the same customers. These new exchanges caused the customers
to incur additional surrender fees.

Therefore, Fortune violated FINRA Rules 3110, 2330, and 2010.

Fortune failed to reasonably supervise Representative B’s use of an external email
address and failed to retain business-related email communications sent by
Representative B and his staff:

FINRA Rule 3110(b)(4) requires member firms to establish, maintain, and enforce
written procedures for, among other things, the review of electronic correspondence
relating to its investment banking or securities business, and require that such review be
evidenced in writing.

FINRA Rule 4511 requires member firms to “preserve books and records as required
under the FINRA rules, the Exchange Act and the applicable Exchange Act rules.”
Section 17 of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 require that member firms
preserve, “for a period of not less than three years, the first two years in a readily
accessible place,” originals of all communications received, and copies of all
communications sent by the member relating to its business. Implicit in the requirement
to make and preserve books and records is the requirement that information in those
books and records be accurate. Emails fall within the purview of Exchange Act 17a-4.
Violations of FINRA Rule 4511 and Exchange Act Rule 17a-4 also constitute a violation
of FINRA Rule 2010.

From September 2017 through November 2020, Representative B and his support staff,
acting at Representative B’s direction, used outside email accounts to communicate with
firm customers. Using these accounts, Representative B and his support staff forwarded
Fortune new account applications, and forms for variable annuity exchanges and
withdrawals, and requested that customers sign and return these documents. In many
instances, these forms were blank or incomplete, and Representative B would complete
the forms after they had already been signed and returned by the customers. Fortune
knew that Representative B and his support staff used outside email accounts for business
purposes, yet the firm failed to review or preserve these emails.

By failing to reasonably supervise Representative B’s use of an outside email account to
conduct securities-related business, Fortune violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.

Additionally, by failing to preserve business-related emails, Fortune violated FINRA
Rules 4511 and 2010, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 17a-4.

SANCTIONS CONSIDERATIONS

In determining the appropriate sanctions in this matter, FINRA considered, among other
factors, (1) that Fortune has agreed to pay restitution to customers affected by
Representative A’s unsuitable recommendations; (ii) Fortune’s current financial
condition; and (iii) that, in lieu of a monetary fine, Fortune will retain an independent
consultant to review and revise the firm’s supervisory system and procedures.

B. Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
. a censure;
. restitution of $612,172.66 plus interest in the amount of $25,183.21;* and
"" an undertaking to retain an independent consultant as described below.

Restitution is ordered to be paid to the customers listed on Attachment A to this AWC
(Eligible Customers) in the total amount of $612,172.66, plus interest in the amount of
$25,183.21, from the date of the misconduct through October 31, 2022.

A registered principal on behalf of Respondent shall submit satisfactory proof of payment
of restitution and interest (separately specifying the date and amount of each paid to each
Eligible Customer) or of reasonable and documented efforts undertaken to effect
restitution. Such proof shall be submitted by email to EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org
from a work-related account of the registered principal of Respondent. The email must
identify Respondent and the case number and include a copy of the check, money order,
or other method of payment. This proof shall be provided by email to
EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org no later than 120 days after the date of the notice of
acceptance of the AWC.

The restitution amount plus interest to be paid to each Eligible Customer shall be treated
by the Respondent as the Eligible Customer’s property for purposes of state escheatment,
unclaimed property, abandoned property, and similar laws. If after reasonable and
documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution Respondent is unable to pay all
Eligible Customers within 120 days after the date of the notice of acceptance of the
AWC, Respondent shall submit to FINRA in the manner described above a list of the
unpaid Eligible Customers and a description of Respondent’s plan, not unacceptable to
FINRA, to comply with the applicable escheatment, unclaimed property, abandoned
property, or similar laws for each such Eligible Customer.

4 In consideration of the General Principles Applicable to all Sanctions Determinations contained in the Sanction
Guidelines, FINRA agreed to assess interest on the restitution owed at a rate below that set forth in Section
6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, after it considered, among other things, the firm’s revenues and financial
resources, as well as its agreement to pay full restitution (with partial interest) to the affected customers.

5

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this
matter.

The imposition of a restitution order in this AWC, and the timing of such ordered
payments, does not preclude customers from pursuing their own actions to obtain
restitution or other remedies.

Restitution payments to customers shall be preceded or accompanied by a letter, not
unacceptable to FINRA, describing the reason for the payment and the fact that the
payment is being made pursuant to a settlement with FINRA and as a term of this AWC.

1. Respondent has undertaken to do the following:

a. Retain at its own expense and within 60 days of the date of the notice of
acceptance of this AWC an independent consultant not unacceptable to
FINRA to conduct a comprehensive review of the adequacy of
Respondent’s compliance with applicable federal securities laws and
FINRA Rules, concerning:

a. Supervision of variable annuity sales and exchanges;

b. Surveillance for inappropriate rates of variable annuity exchanges;
and

c. Supervision and retention of electronic business-related
communications with firm customers, including through
unapproved means of communication.

b. Ensure that the independent consultant, any firm with which the
independent consultant is affiliated or of which he or she is a member, and
any person engaged to assist the independent consultant in performance of
his or her duties, shall not have provided consulting, legal, auditing, or
other professional services to, or had any affiliation with, Respondent
during the two years prior to the date of the notice of acceptance of this
AWC.

(er Cooperate with the independent consultant in all respects, including
providing the independent consultant with access to Respondent’s files,
books, records, and personnel, as reasonably requested for the above-
mentioned review. Respondent shall require the independent consultant to
report to FINRA on its activities as FINRA may request and shall place no
restrictions on the independent consultant’s communications with FINRA.
Further, upon request, Respondent shall make available to FINRA any and
all communications between the independent consultant and the

Respondent and documents examined by the independent consultant in
connection with this review.

Refrain from terminating the relationship with the independent consultant
without FINRA’s written approval. Respondent shall not be in and shall
not have an attorney-client relationship with the independent consultant
and shall not seek to invoke the attorney-client privilege or other doctrine
or privilege to prevent the independent consultant from transmitting any
information, reports, or documents to FINRA.

Require the independent consultant to submit an initial written report to
Respondent and FINRA at the conclusion of the independent consultant’s
review, which shall be no more than 120 days after the date of the notice
of acceptance of this AWC. The initial report shall, at a minimum,

(i) provide a description of the review performed and the conclusions
reached; (ii) evaluate and address the adequacy of Respondent’s
supervision of variable annuity exchanges, and patterns of customer
exchanges, and supervision of electronic communications (iii) make
recommendations as may be needed regarding how Respondent should
modify or supplement its processes, controls, policies, systems,
procedures, and training to manage its regulatory and other risks in
relation to supervision of variable annuity sales and exchanges, and
supervision of electronic communications; and

(i) Within forty-five days after delivery of the initial report,
Respondent shall adopt and implement the recommendations of the
independent consultant or, if Respondent considers a
recommendation to be, in whole or in part, unduly burdensome or
impractical, propose an alternative procedure to the independent
consultant designed to achieve the same objective. Respondent
shall submit such proposed alternative procedures in writing
simultaneously to the independent consultant and FINRA.

(ii) | Respondent shall require the independent consultant to
(A) reasonably evaluate the alternative procedures and determine
whether it will achieve the same objective as the independent
consultant’s original recommendation and (B) provide Respondent
and FINRA with a written report reflecting its evaluation and
determination within thirty days of submission of any
Respondent’s proposed alternative procedures. In the event the
independent consultant and Respondent are unable to agree,
Respondent must abide by the independent consultant’s ultimate
determination with respect to any proposed alternative procedure
and must adopt and implement all recommendations deemed
appropriate by the independent consultant.

(ii) | Within thirty days after the issuance of the later of the independent
consultant’s initial report or any written report regarding proposed
alternative procedures, Respondent shall provide the independent
consultant and FINRA with a written implementation report,
certified by an officer of Respondent, attesting to, containing
documentation of, and setting forth the details of Respondent’s
implementation of the independent consultant’s recommendations.
The certification shall identify the undertakings, provide written
evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be
supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance.
FINRA may make reasonable requests for further evidence of
compliance, and Respondent agrees to provide such evidence.

f. Require the independent consultant to enter into a written agreement that,
for the duration of the engagement and for a period of two years from the
completion of the engagement, the independent consultant shall not enter

","FINRA found that from July 2016 to July 2021, Fortune Financial Services failed to reasonably supervise variable annuity sales and exchanges, including failing to detect a registered representative's pattern of unsuitable short-term exchanges that caused customers to incur over $600,000 in surrender charges. Fortune also failed to supervise another representative's use of an unapproved email address and retain his business emails from 2017-2020. As a result, Fortune was censured, ordered to pay restitution of over $600,000 plus interest to affected customers, and required to retain an independent consultant to review its supervisory policies and procedures related to variable annuities and electronic communications.

Member Firm
CRD No. 31148

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Long Island Financial Group, Inc. (LIFG) submits
this Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement
of the alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND

LIFG became a FINRA member firm in 1993. The firm is in Long Island, New York, and
has five registered representatives. The firm provides services to retail customers,
focusing on sales of equities, mutual funds, and variable annuities. !

OVERVIEW

Since June 30, 2020, LIFG has failed to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Exchange Act Rule 15/-
1 (Regulation Best Interest or Reg BI). Additionally, LIFG failed to establish and
maintain a supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures (WSPs),
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI. As a result, LIFG violated
Exchange Act Rule 15/-1 and FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.

During this period, LIFG also failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system,
including WSPs, reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Exchange Act Rule
17a-14 obligations to prepare, file, and deliver its Form CRS. As a result, LIFG violated
FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This matter originated from the firm’s 2021 cycle examination.

LIFG Failed to Have Written Policies and Procedures, and a Supervisory System,
Reasonably Designed to Achieve Compliance with Regulation Best Interest

As of June 30, 2020, broker-dealers and their associated persons are required to comply
with Reg BI under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Reg BI requires a broker, dealer,
or a natural person associated with a broker or dealer, when making a recommendation of
any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities (including account
recommendations) to a retail customer, to act in the best interest of that retail customer at
the time the recommendation is made, without placing the financial or other interest of
the broker, dealer, or associated person ahead of the interest of the retail customer.

Reg BI’s Compliance Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule 15/-1(a)(2)(iv), requires
a broker-dealer to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI. Reg BI’s Adopting Release
provides that broker-dealers should consider the nature of that firm’s operations and how
to design such policies and procedures to prevent violations from occurring, to detect
violations that have occurred, and to correct promptly any violations that have occurred.

Additionally, Reg BI’s Conflict of Interest Obligation, set forth at Exchange Act Rule
15/-1(a)(2)(iii), requires broker-dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures addressing conflicts of interest, defined as interests that might
incline a broker-dealer or an associated person—consciously or unconsciously—to make
a recommendation that is not disinterested. Such procedures must be, among other things,
reasonably designed to identify and mitigate any conflicts of interest associated with
recommendations to retail customers that create an incentive for an associated person to
place the firm’s interest, or the associated person’s interest, ahead of the customer’s
interest. This obligation applies to incentives that are provided to the associated person,
whether by the firm or third parties, that are within the control of or associated with the
broker-dealer’s business.

FINRA Rule 3110 requires member firms to establish, maintain, and enforce a
supervisory system, including WSPs, to supervise the activities of each associated person
that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws,
regulations, and FINRA rules.

A violation of Exchange Act Rule 15/-1 and FINRA Rule 3110 also is a violation of
FINRA Rule 2010, which requires member firms to observe high standards of
commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade in the conduct of their
business.

From June 30, 2020, to the present, LIFG failed to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BL.
LIFG also failed to establish, maintain, and enforce a supervisory system, including

2

WSPs, reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI. From June 30, 2020, to
November 1, 2021, the firm failed to make any reference to Reg BI in its written policies
and procedures. On November 1, 2021, the firm began to use written policies and
procedures that contained general background information about Reg BI but still had no
procedures to prevent, detect, or promptly correct violations of Reg BI or to otherwise
achieve compliance with Reg BI.

Therefore, LIFG violated Exchange Act Rule 15/-1 and FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.

LIFG Failed to Have a Supervisory System, Including WSPs, Reasonably Designed
to Achieve Compliance with Form CRS Obligations

On June 5, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted Form CRS
and rules creating new requirements—which include requirements to prepare, file and
deliver the Form CRS pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17a-14—for SEC-registered
broker-dealers offering services to a retail investor. The compliance date for Form CRS
was June 30, 2020.

Form CRS provides customers with information about the types of services the firm
offers; the fees, costs, conflicts of interest, and required standard of conduct associated
with those services; whether the firm and its investment professionals have reportable
legal or disciplinary history; and how to get more information about the firm.

From June 30, 2020, to the present, LIFG failed to establish and maintain a supervisory
system, including WSPs, reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Form CRS
requirements. From June 30, 2020, to November 1, 2021, the firm failed to make any
reference to Form CRS in its WSPs. On November 1, 2021, the firm began to use WSPs
that contained general background information about Form CRS but still had no
procedures regarding the preparation, filing, and distribution of the Form CRS. As of
March 2022, the firm was again using WSPs that made no reference to Form CRS.

Therefore, LIFG violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
. a censure;

. a $35,000 fine; and

7 an undertaking that, within 90 days of the date of the notice of acceptance of this
AWC, a member of Respondent’s senior management who is a registered
principal of the firm shall certify in writing that, as of the date of the certification,
the firm has remediated the issues identified in this AWC and (1) implemented
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with
Reg BI and (2) implemented a supervisory system, including written supervisory
procedures, reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Exchange Act Rules
15/-1 and 17a-14 regarding the issues identified in this AWC. The certification

3

shall include a narrative description and supporting exhibits sufficient to
demonstrate Respondent’s remediation and implementation. FINRA staff may
request further evidence of Respondent’s remediation and implementation, and
Respondent agrees to provide such evidence. Respondent shall submit the
certification to Shane B. Kelly, Counsel, 4600 S. Syracuse Street, Suite 1400,
Denver, Colorado, 80237, or electronically to shane.kelly@finra.org, with a copy
to EnforcementNotice@finra.org. Upon written request showing good cause,
FINRA staff may extend this deadline.

Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this

matter.

The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.

II.

WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:

A.

B.

To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against it;

To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations

To appeal any such decision to the National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) and
then to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court of
Appeals.

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such
person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.

' For more information about the firm and Quint, visit BrokerCheck® at www. finra.org/brokercheck.

OVERVIEW

During the period of January 2020 to March 2020, QCC and Quint permitted an
individual who was subject to a statutory disqualification to associate with QCC in
violation of FINRA By-Laws Article III, Section 3(b), FINRA Rules 8311 and 2010, and
MSRB Rules G-4 and G-5. During that same period, QCC and Quint further permitted
the individual to engage in activities requiring registration as a Municipal Securities
Representative in violation of MSRB Rules G-2 and G-3.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This matter originated from an arbitration filing.

Article III, Section 3(b) of FINRA’s By-Laws provides that no person shall continue to
be associated with a FINRA member firm if the person becomes subject to statutory
disqualification.

In addition, FINRA Rule 8311(a) provides in part that:

Ifa person is subject to a suspension, revocation, cancellation of registration,
bar from association with a member (each a sanction"") or other
disqualification, a member shall not allow such person to be associated with it
in any capacity that is inconsistent with the sanction imposed or disqualified
status, including a clerical or ministerial capacity.

FINRA Rule 2010 provides that associated persons shall, in the conduct of their business,
observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.

MSRB Rule G-4(a) provides, in part, that:

no broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer or natural person shall be
qualified for purposes of rule G-2 if, by action of a national securities exchange
or registered securities association, such broker, dealer or municipal securities
dealer has been and is expelled or suspended from membership or participation
in such exchange or association, or such natural person has been and is barred
or suspended from being associated with a member of such exchange or
association... (ii) by reason of any statutory disqualification of the character
described in subparagraphs (C), (D), (E) or (F) of section 3(a)(39) of the
[Exchange] Act.

MSRB Rule G-5(a) provides, in part, that:
no natural person shall be associated with a broker, dealer or municipal
securities dealer in contravention of any effective restrictions imposed upon

such person by the [U.S. Securities and Exchange] Commission pursuant to
sections 15(b)(6) or 15B(c)(4) of the Act or by an appropriate regulatory

2

agency pursuant to section 15B(c)(5) of the Act or by a registered securities
association pursuant to rules adopted under section 15A(b)(7) of the Act.

MSRB Rule G-2 provides that:

No broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer shall effect any transaction in,
or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any municipal security,
and no municipal advisor shall engage in municipal advisory activities, unless
such broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer or municipal advisor and
every natural person associated with such broker, dealer, municipal securities
dealer or municipal advisor is qualified in accordance with the rules of the
Board.

MSRB Rule G-3(a)(i) defines the term “municipal securities representative” to mean:

a natural person associated with a broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer,
other than a person whose functions are solely clerical or ministerial, whose
activities include one or more of the following:

(1) underwriting, trading or sales of municipal securities;

(2) financial advisory or consultant services for issuers in connection with the
issuance of municipal securities;

(3) research or investment advice with respect to municipal securities; or

(4) any other activities which involve communication, directly or indirectly, with
public investors in municipal securities;

provided, however, that the activities enumerated in subparagraphs (3) and (4)
above shall be limited to such activities as they relate to the activities enumerated
in subparagraphs (1) and (2) above.

MSRB Rule G-3 further states that a Municipal Securities Representative is not qualified
for purposes of Rule G-2 until the individual has taken and passed, among others, the
Municipal Securities Representative Qualification Examination (the Series 52).

Quint was the principal at QCC responsible for supervising QCC’s compliance with
licensing and registration matters, including matters relating to statutory disqualification.
In February 2018, Quint signed and submitted on behalf of QCC a Membership
Continuance Application (“MC-400 Application”) seeking to permit Individual A to
associate with the firm despite Individual A being statutorily disqualified under Section
3(a)(39) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 due to an SEC bar and a federal district
court order enjoining Individual A from violating various federal securities laws and
regulations.”

2 The SEC bar fell within, among others, MSRB Rule G-5. The federal district court order fell within subparagraph
(F) of section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act and thus MSRB Rule G-4 also applied.

In November 2019, FINRA’s National Adjudicatory Council issued a Notice Pursuant to
Exchange Act Rule 19h-1 approving the application for Individual A to associate with the
firm as a GSR. However, as stated in the Notice and in FINRA’s letter to Quint and QCC
accompanying the Notice, under FINRA Rule 9524(b)(3) the Notice would become
effective only after the issuance of an order from the SEC stating that the SEC would not
institute proceedings pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and that it will not
direct otherwise pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15A(g)(2). The SEC never issued
such an order, and the Notice never became effective.

From January 2020 to March 2020, at a time when the Notice was not effective and
Individual A was not registered as a Municipal Securities Representative, QCC and Quint
nevertheless permitted Individual A to associate with the firm and to engage in activities
requiring registration as a Municipal Securities Representative. Specifically, Quint and
QCC provided Individual A with passwords and access to electronic systems and
platforms at QCC to trade municipal bonds. With QCC and Quint’s knowledge,
Individual A referred four customers, including a married couple, to open accounts at
QCC, discussed municipal securities transactions with those customers and effected
approximately 25 municipal securities purchase and sale transactions for the accounts of
those customers.

In March 2021, Quint caused QCC to withdraw the MC-400 Application for Individual
A, and to file a Uniform Termination Notice for Securities Industry Registration (Form
U5) terminating Individual A’s association with the firm.?

By permitting Individual A to engage in the activities described above, Quint and QCC
permitted a barred and statutorily disqualified individual to associate with the firm.
Therefore, Quint and QCC violated Article III, Section 3(b) of FINRA’s By-Laws,
FINRA Rules 8311 and 2010, and MSRB Rules G-4 and G-5.

In addition, QCC and Quint permitted Individual A to engage in activity requiring
registration as a Municipal Securities Representative. Therefore, QCC and Quint violated
MSRB Rules G-2 and G-3.

B. Respondents also consent to the imposition of the following sanctions:
For QCC:

="" acensure and

= a $35,000 fine ($26,250 of which pertains to violations of MSRB Rules).

3 Individual A was barred from associating with any FINRA member in 2022 for failing to provide testimony
requested pursuant to FINRA Rule 8210 in violation of FINRA Rules 8210 and 2010.

For Quint:
= a five-month suspension in all principal capacities and
= a$10,000 fine ($7,500 of which pertains to violations of MSRB Rules).

Respondents agree to pay the monetary sanctions upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payments are due and payable. Respondents submitted Election of
Payment forms showing the method by which they propose to pay the fines imposed.

Respondents specifically and voluntarily waive any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanctions imposed in this
matter.

Respondent Quint understands that if he is barred or suspended from associating with any
FINRA member in a principal capacity, he becomes subject to a statutory disqualification
as that term is defined in Article IIL, Section 4 of FINRA’s By-Laws, incorporating
Section 3(a)(39) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, Respondent Quint
may not be associated with any FINRA member in a principal capacity, during the period
of the bar or suspension. See FINRA Rules 8310 and 8311.

The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.

L

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted pursuant to Sections 19(h) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”) against The Options Clearing Corporation (“OCC” or “Respondent”.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting
Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 19(h) and 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a
Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds! that:

Summary

1. These proceedings arise out of OCC’s failure to implement and comply with its
Stress Testing and Clearing Fund Methodology rule in violation of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iii) under
the Exchange Act and Section 19(g) of the Exchange Act from October 2019 until May 2021.
OCC’s failure to implement and comply with its own rule was the result of its failure to establish,
implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage
its operational risks by identifying the plausible sources of operational risk and mitigating their
impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls in violation of
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(i) under the Exchange Act. As a result of these failures, OCC’s Clearing
Fund was underfunded nearly $600 million during certain times in the period October 2019 through
May 2021. OCC’s failure to implement the rule involved OCC’s Comprehensive Stress Testing
(“CST”) System, one of OCC’s critical SCI systems, which it had failed to modify as required by
its rule. OCC failed to provide timely notification to the Commission of this event, as required
under Regulation SCI. OCC also failed to comply with its margin methodology, margin policy,
and stress testing and clearing fund methodology relating to specific wrong way risk and holiday
margin in violation of Section 19(g) of the Exchange Act.

2. OCC serves as the sole registered clearing agency for exchange listed option
contracts in the United States and has been designated as a systemically important financial market
utility (“SIFMU”) under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 (““Dodd-Frank Act’). Disruption to OCC’s operations, or failure by OCC to
manage risk, could result in significant costs not only to OCC itself and its members, but also to
other market participants or the broader U.S. financial system.

3 As a registered clearing agency, OCC is a self-regulatory organization under the
Exchange Act. Self-regulatory organizations are charged with an important public trust to carry
out their self-regulatory responsibilities effectively and fairly, while fostering free and open
markets, protecting investors, and promoting the public trust. OCC, as a self-regulatory
organization, is required to comply with its own rules after they are approved by the Commission.

4. The U.S. Congress and the Commission have established a legal framework to
facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, having due
regard for, among other things, the public interest, the protection of investors, and the safeguarding
of securities and funds.

| The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not

binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

2.

5. In October 2016, the Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-22(e) under the Exchange
Act, which established enhanced standards for registered clearing agencies that meet the definition
of a “covered clearing agency.” OCC is a covered clearing agency for purposes of Rule 17Ad-
22(e). The Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-22(e) to “impos[e] consistent, higher minimum risk
management standards across all covered clearing agencies” and “further mitigate the potential for
moral hazard associated with risk management at a covered clearing agency.””

6. In November 2014, the Commission adopted Regulation Systems, Compliance, and
Integrity under the Exchange Act (“Regulation SCY’) to “strengthen the technology infrastructure
of U.S. securities markets” and “reduce the occurrence of systems issues, improve resiliency
when systems problems do occur, and enhance the Commission’s oversight and enforcement of
securities market technology infrastructure.”? Regulation SCI requires SCI entities to take
corrective action with respect to SCI events, defined to include systems disruptions, systems
compliance issues, and systems intrusions, notify the Commission of such events, and disseminate
information about certain SCI events to affected members or participants.’

‘Tk Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iii) under the Exchange Act requires OCC to establish,
implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
effectively identify, measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposures to participants and those
arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes, including by maintaining additional
financial resources at the minimum to enable it to cover a wide range of foreseeable stress
scenarios that include, but are not limited to, the default of the participant family that would
potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the covered clearing agency in extreme
but plausible market conditions.

8. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(i) under the Exchange Act requires OCC to establish,
implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage
the covered clearing agency’s operational risks by, among other things, identifying the plausible
sources of operational risk, both internal and external, and mitigating their impact through the use
of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls. In adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17), the
Commission stated that the rule concerns operational risks that stem from deficiencies in internal
controls, human errors, and management failures.

9. As a result of its conduct, OCC violated Section 17A(d)(1) of the Exchange Act*

Respondent

10. OCC is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Chicago,
Illinois. OCC is the sole clearing agency for standardized U.S. securities options listed on
Commission-registered national securities exchanges. The Commission granted full registration as
a clearing agency to OCC pursuant to the Exchange Act on September 23, 1983.° As a registered
clearing agency, OCC is a self-regulatory organization under the Exchange Act.

11. On July 18, 2012, the Financial Stability Oversight Council approved the
designation of OCC as a SIFMU pursuant to Section 804 of the Dodd-Frank Act. A financial
market utility is deemed to be systemically important if “the failure of or a disruption to the
functioning of such [financial market utility] could create or increase the risk of significant
liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten
the stability” of the U.S. financial system.’ For purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission
is OCC’s Supervisory Agency. As such, the Commission is required by Section 807(a) of the
Dodd-Frank Act to examine OCC at least once annually. In addition, because it is a SIFMU and a
registered clearing agency that provides the services of a central counterparty, OCC is a “covered
clearing agency” subject to the Commission’s enhanced clearing agency standards set forth in
Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-22(e).

12. On September 4, 2019, the Commission instituted settled Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist proceedings and censured OCC based on its failures to establish and enforce
policies and procedures involving financial risk management, operational requirements, and
information-systems security. The Order found that OCC failed to come into compliance with the
statutes and rules relating to these policies and procedures despite the Commission staffs advance
warnings and ample time to comply. OCC, without admitting or denying the Commission’s
findings, agreed to pay a $15 million penalty. The Commission’s Order found that OCC violated
Section 17A(d)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17Ad-22(b)(2), 17Ad-22(d)(1), 17Ad-22(e)(1),
17Ad-22(e)(3)(i), 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii1) and (vi), 17Ad-22(e)(6)(i), and 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (vi)
thereunder; Rules 1001(a)(1) and (2) of Regulation SCI under the Exchange Act; and Section
19(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 19b-4 thereunder. OCC also was required to, and did hire an

as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.

Unless exempted, a clearing agency must register with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 17A. 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(1). Such registration requires

Facts

The Commission Approved OCC’s Proposed Rule Change to its Margin Methodology, Margin
Policy and Stress Testing and Clearing Fund Methodology

13. In February 2017, OCC began working on a Liquidation Cost Model Enhancements
€LCME”’) project, which it commissioned to address deficiencies in its margin methodology that
had been previously identified by the Commission staff in regulatory examinations. Among other
things, the project provided for the development of a model to properly account for the Liquidation
Cost Charge (“LC Charge”) as an addition to OCC’s base margin requirements.

14. The LC Charge is an estimate of the cost to be incurred by OCC in the event it is
required to close out a Clearing Member’s portfolio in the event of a default by the Clearing
Member. In calculating OCC’s margin requirements, the LC Charge was to be added to its base
margin calculation to address the potential costs associated with closing out a defaulted Clearing
Member’s portfolio. OCC also proposed to change its stress testing and Clearing Fund
methodology to reflect the inclusion of the LC Charge as an add-on to OCC’s base margin
requirements and how the liquidation cost charge add-on would be incorporated in Clearing Fund
shortfall calculations.

15. OCC described the proposed changes to OCC’s Margin Methodology, Margin
Policy, and Stress Testing and Clearing Fund Methodology Description to add a risk-based
liquidation charge to adjust the value of positions to account for the costs of liquidating a
defaulting Clearing Member’s portfolio in a proposed rule change that OCC filed with the
Commission in April 2019 (the proposed LCME rule).? The proposed rule change stated that a
charge for liquidation costs using the same values as calculated for margins was to be included in
Clearing Fund shortfall calculations to ensure that the liquidation cost charge was part of its
required total credit financial resources.

§ OCC’s base margin requirements are intended to cover potential losses due to price
movements, as opposed to the additional liquidation costs OCC may incur in closing out
a defaulted Clearing Member’s portfolio.

? See Exchange Act Release 85755 (Apr. 30, 2019), 84 Fed. Reg. 19815 (May 6, 2019)
(File No. SR-OCC-2019-004).

16. On June 17, 2019, the Commission approved OCC’s proposed LCME rule pursuant
to Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.'° Consistent with the proposed
tule change, OCC did not implement the LCME rule immediately upon approval.

17. In accepting OCC’s offer of settlement and determining the sanctions to be imposed
as part of the 2019 enforcement action against OCC, the Commission considered OCC’s remedial
efforts, which included, among other things, the rule change described above.

OCC Failed To Establish and Implement Policies and Procedures Reasonably Designed
To Manage Its Operational Risks And Failed to Implement and Comply With Its LCME Rule
With Regard To Its Stress Testing and Clearing Fund Methodology

18. In October 2019, OCC incorporated the LC Charge into its margin methodology.
However, OCC failed to implement its LCME rule with regard to its stress testing and Clearing
Fund methodology. Due to deficiencies in certain internal controls, human errors, and
management failures, discussed below, OCC did not incorporate the LC Charge into its Clearing
Fund systems until June 2021. OCC’s failure to implement and comply with its own rule was due
to its failure to establish and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage its
operational risk stemming from such deficiencies, errors, and failures.

19. Beginning in or about 2018, in addition to working on the LCME project, and also
in response to deficiencies identified by Commission staff, OCC was in the process of developing
new Clearing Fund systems policies, procedures and controls and developing software to
incorporate these changes into its CST System (the “CST project”). The CST project was in
process at the same time as the LCME project.

20. The LCME project was primarily margin focused and the CST project was
primarily Clearing Fund focused, and the two projects were managed by different OCC teams.

21. Despite the fact that the LC Charge was required to be incorporated into both the
margin and Clearing Fund methodologies, the teams operated in silos, and there was limited
interaction between the LCME and CST project teams. Although both the CST and margin
methodologies referenced the LC Charge, neither the CST nor the LCME project teams included
incorporating the LC Charge into the CST System in the scope of its work. The CST project team
believed the incorporation of the LC Charge into the CST System was outside the scope of its work
and would be addressed by the LCME project team. As discussed below, there were several times
in 2018 when the need to implement the Clearing Fund-related requirement for the LC Charge
functionality was raised within the LCME project team and not addressed. The LCME project
team did not coordinate with the CST team to ensure that the LC Charge was incorporated into
both the margin and Clearing Fund methodologies.

10 See In the Matter of Options Clearing Corporation, Exchange Act Release No. 86871
(Sept. 4, 2019) (paragraph 61(c)(vi)).

22. In February 2017, at the inception of the LCME project, OCC used a “Waterfall”
project management methodology that included a number of project documents, such as a Business
Requirements document, a Quality Assurance System Test Strategy, and a Project Development
Checklist, to guide the project team through the project’s development, testing and
implementation.

23. The Business Requirements Document stated: “The LC add-on charge will be
excluded from Clearing Fund calculations in the same way other add-on charges are excluded.” It
also stated: “The new Liquidity charge will not be implemented [sic] comprehensive stress
testing.” OCC also created a Quality Assurance System Test Strategy that included similar
language, including a requirement for the Quality Assurance (“QA”) to “Verify the LC add-on
charge will be excluded from Clearing Fund calculations in the same way other add-on charges are
excluded.” Similarly, the Project Development Checklist stated that “The LC add-on charge will
be excluded from Clearing Fund calculations in the same way other add-on charges are excluded.”

24. In approximately April, 2018, OCC changed from the “Waterfall” project
management system methodology to the “Agile” methodology. As part of the Agile methodology,
OCC began using electronic tickets to track specific tasks that needed to be completed in
connection with the implementation of a project, including the requirement that the LC Charge be
incorporated into the CST System. The LCME project was not migrated to the Agile system but
was instead treated as a hybrid project that relied on the initial waterfall documents and subsequent
tickets created as part of an Agile methodology for LCME project deliverables. However, the
Project Development Checklist was not updated to include a requirement that the LCME project
team review the open tickets created in the Agile system prior to project sign-off, and open tickets
relating to the requirement that the LC Charge be incorporated into the CST System were not
reviewed before the LCME project was closed out.

25. From June through August 2018, various OCC staff flagged the impact of the LC
Charge on the Clearing Fund for the LCME project staff several times. In August 2018, the
LCME project team deferred any work on that task, referencing the impending changes regarding
the CST System. A QA team member noted the need for the functionality in a ticket in the Agile
system as well.

26. Later in August 2018, IT flagged the issue of the treatment of the LC Charge in the
Clearing Fund calculation for the LCME project team, who, in an August 2018 meeting, discussed
that the requirement needed to be completed in the future and that the work should be performed
after the CST System went into production. After this meeting, IT created a ticket in the Agile
system documenting the need for completion of this work as part of the CST System, and other
tickets were added documenting the need for implementation and testing of the functionality with
regard to the CST System.

21. OCC Quantitative Risk Management (“QRM7”) personnel discussed the LC Charge
as it related to the Clearing Fund methodology at a meeting with Commission staff on October 24,

2018, and on November 13, 2018, Commission staff asked OCC to address the treatment of the LC
Charge in the Clearing Fund calculation in its proposed LCME tule filing.

28. On or about October 30, 2018, OCC’s Financial Risk Management Group (“FRM”)
assigned the tickets created in the Agile system, which documented the need to complete the work
to incorporate the LC Charge into the CST System, a lower priority because OCC had other IT
projects with near-term deadlines and the LCME project did not have a definitive implementation
date because OCC was still working on its proposed rule filing relating to the project.

29. When the LC Charge Add-On software code was moved into production in October
2019 with regard to OCC’s margin methodology, the LCME project team did not re-prioritize the
incorporation of the LC Charge into the CST System as something to be implemented by the
LCME project team or to be reassigned to the CST team. Instead, tickets relating to the need to
incorporate the LC Charge into the CST System were categorized as “Business As Usual” items
involving issues that were not material to the LCME project team. The Waterfall documents did
not require the LCME project team to review open tickets created in the Agile system, and the
LCME project team did not review the relevant open tickets before moving them into this category
and closing out the LCME project.

30. As a result of the above, OCC’s functional testing of the LCME methodology did
not include testing of the CST System prior to or after it was put into production even though the
CST System had already been implemented at the time that the LCME project code went into
production in October 2019.

31. In addition, OCC’s Model Validation Group (“MVG”) team did not detect that the
LC Charge had not been incorporated into OCC’s Clearing Fund methodology through the CST
System when it validated the LCME model. Pursuant to OCC’s then existing Model Validation
Procedure, MVG validated the LCME and CST models independently during its annual model
validation process. OCC’s policies and procedures did not require MVG to look at business logic
or accounting functionality as part of its validation process or to look across models. As a result,
MVG did not review whether the LC Charge was incorporated into the Clearing Fund
methodology or CST System during its initial or annual validation of the LCME and CST models.

32. Further, OCC’s Internal Audit Department (“IAD”) did not detect that the LC
Charge had not been incorporated into the Clearing Fund methodology through the CST System
during its 2020 audits. LAD did not include testing the Clearing Fund LC Charge within the scope
of the 2020 audits. As part of its audits, IAD obtained MVG’s technical evaluations and engaged
subject matter experts to determine if MVG’s work was reasonably designed and effectively
executed. In performing the audits, LAD relied on MVG’s technical work, which did not look at
business logic, accounting functionality or across models. Since MVG did not look across models
and IAD did not reexamine MVG’s technical work, the error continued to go undetected.

33. In 2020 and related to model testing, [AD performed validation of two regulatory
findings relating to the LC Charge issue and one audit. IAD concluded that the margin model was

8

reasonably designed and that MVG’s testing of the operational effectiveness of the model was
reasonably designed. IAD also completed a Clearing Fund Audit in November 2020, in which it
tested controls related to the Clearing Fund Resizing and Replenishment process and reviewed the
model that supported Clearing Fund sizing. The scope of the Audit included auditing MVG’s
operational effectiveness testing. [AD concluded that the model design was reasonably effective
and MVG’s operational effectiveness testing was effective.

34. From October 2019, until May 17, 2021, OCC failed to properly account for the LC
Charge in its Clearing Fund shortfall calculation.

35. As a result of these failures, OCC’s Clearing Fund was underfunded by nearly $600
million at certain times during the period October 2019 through May 2021. At its height in early
May 2021, OCC’s Clearing Fund was $588 million smaller than was required under OCC’s rules.!!

OCC Failed to Properly Notify Commission Staff of its Clearing Fund Shortfall
Under Regulation SCI

36. OCC first realized that the LC Charge was not included in the shortfall calculation
for its Clearing Fund in OCC’s CST System on April 21, 2021. On April 21, 2021, in reviewing
OCC’s April 15 responses to the Commission staff’s requests for information regarding a separate
matter, a member of OCC’s Stress Testing and Liquidity Risk Management Group in FRM
observed that OCC’s Comprehensive Stress Testing and Clearing Fund Methodology Description
and Liquidity Risk Management Description stated that “a charge for LC using the same values as
calculated for margins is included in shortfall calculations to ensure that LC is part of the required
total credit financial resources.” He noted that OCC had not incorporated the LC Charge into its
calculation for the Clearing Fund.

37. Later that day, that OCC employee notified the executive director in OCC’s Stress
Testing and Liquidity Risk Management Group, who served as a responsible SCI personnel
delegate. They scheduled a meeting to discuss the issue the next day with employees of FRM,
Credit Risk Management (“CRM”) and QRM, as well as a member of OCC Legal. The FRM and
CRM teams continued to analyze and quantify the issue throughout the next week. After that
work, the FRM team discussed this issue at two April 28 meetings. Later in the day on April 28,
OCC’s CEO and COO were briefed on the issue. On April 30, OCC’s Chief Financial Risk Officer
(“CFRO”) briefed the Chairman of the Board and Chairs of the Regulatory Committee and Risk

i OCC’s failure to implement and comply with its LCME Rule, resulting in the Clearing
Fund being underfunded by nearly $600 million at certain times during the relevant
period, violated Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iii) under the Exchange Act. However, as of the
time that OCC discovered that the LC Charge was not included in the shortfall
calculation for its Clearing Fund, OCC’s Clearing Fund had maintained financial
resources sufficient to meet its obligations in the event of a default by the single member
or participant family creating the largest financial exposure in extreme but plausible

market conditions.
9

Committee of OCC’s Board. On Monday, May 3, the CFRO updated OCC’s Management
Committee.

38. OCC did not contact Commission staff to schedule a meeting to discuss the issue
until May 4, 2021.

39. On May 5, 2021, OCC informed the Commission’s staff that for more than 18
months, OCC had failed to incorporate the cost of liquidating a Clearing Member’s portfolio when
calculating the size of its Clearing Fund.

40. On May 16, 2021, OCC told the Commission’s staff that it was going to use its
authority to immediately resize its Clearing Fund by requiring additional financial resources from
its Clearing Members the next day. On May 17, 2021, OCC increased the size of its Clearing Fund
from $11.23 billion to $11.82 billion, an increase of $588 million or 5.24%, in order comply with
its LCME rule as approved by the Commission.

41. While OCC orally briefed certain members of the Commission’s staff about the
issue in May 2021, OCC did not submit an SCI event notification to the Commission until it
submitted its quarterly de minimis SCI events list on July 30, 2021. OCC’s failure to incorporate
the LC Charge into the CST system resulting in the underfunding of the Clearing Fund as
described above was not a de minimis SCI event.

OCC Failed to Comply With Its Margin Methodology, Margin Policy and Stress Testing and
Clearing Fund Methodology Relating To Specific Wrong Way Risk and Holiday Margin

42. The 2019 OIP found that OCC violated Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(i) because, among
other things, OCC’s margin model failed to consider specific wrong way risk associated with
cleared securities which are related to Clearing Members.!* 2019 OIP at 5-6.

43. On December 11, 2019, OCC received Commission approval to revise its Margin
Methodology and Clearing Fund and Stress Testing Methodology, in part to add a new specific
wrong way risk (“SWWR’”) add-on charge for margin. The approved rule also required OCC to
exclude the SWWR add-on charge from its stress testing scenarios.

44. Also on December 11, 2019, OCC received approval to introduce “idiosyncratic
scenarios” to its suite of Clearing Fund sizing scenarios to be stress tested.

45. OCC maintains five Clearing Fund sizing stress test scenarios. OCC failed to
exclude the SWWR add-on charge in one of these scenarios, the “idiosyncratic scenario,” as
required by its rules.

R “Specific wrong-way risk arises at a [central counterparty] when an exposure to a participant
is highly likely to increase when the creditworthiness of that participant is deteriorating.” 81
Fed. Reg. 70786, 70789 n.317.
10

46. OCC discovered that the SWWR add-on charge had not been excluded from the
“idiosyncratic scenario” in late April 2021 in the course of assessing the impact of the LC Charge
issue on the size of the Clearing Fund. It subsequently remediated the issue.

47. OCC’s rules require OCC to calculate and collect additional margin in advance of
holidays, such as those U.S. holidays during which OCC and its settlement banks are closed but
some futures exchanges are open (“OCC Closed Holiday”). The calculation of holiday margin is
based on the greater of SPAN risk (on a gross basis) and STANS risk (on a net basis). From at
least 2016 through May 2021, the process for calculating margin requirements for OCC Closed
Holidays was not automated. Instead, the calculation was performed using a Visual Basic script,
which did not specify whether margin requirements were based on STANS or SPAN risk.

48. In late May 2021, OCC discovered that margin for OCC Closed Holiday had been
calculated based on 10% of the SPAN risk rather than the STANS risk since 2016 due to an error
in the original Visual Basic script. Upon identification, the issue was remediated, and OCC
ceased using this software.

49. OCC reported both of these issues to Commission staff on July 1, 2021.
Violations

50. As a result of the conduct described above, OCC violated Exchange Act Rule
17Ad-22(e)(17)(i), which requires that OCC establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage the covered clearing agency’s operational
risks by identifying the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal and external, and
mitigating their impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls.

51. As a result of the conduct described above, OCC violated Exchange Act Rule
17Ad-22(e)(4)(iii), which requires that OCC establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to effectively identify, measure, monitor, and manage
its credit exposures to participants and those arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement
processes, including by maintaining additional financial resources at the minimum to enable it to
cover a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios that include, but are not limited to, the default of
the participant family that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the
covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions.

52, As a result of the conduct described above, OCC violated Section 17A(d)(1) of
the Exchange Act, which prohibits OCC from engaging in any activity in contravention of such
tules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate, in the public
interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the
Exchange Act.

53. As a result of the conduct described above, OCC violated Rule 1002(b)(1) of
Regulation SCI, which requires that OCC, upon having a reasonable basis to conclude that an SCI

11

event has occurred, notify the Commission of such SCI event immediately.

54. As a result of the conduct described above, OCC violated Rule 1002(b)(2) of
Regulation SCI, which requires that OCC, within 24 hours of any responsible SCI personnel
having a reasonable basis to conclude that the SCI event has occurred, submit a written notification
pertaining to such SCI event to the Commission.

55. As a result of the conduct described above, OCC violated Section 19(g) of the
Exchange Act, which requires a self-regulatory organization, including its members and persons
associated with its members, to comply with its own rules.

Cooperation and Remediation

56. In determining to accept OCC’s Offer, the Commission has considered remedial
acts undertaken by OCC and the cooperation afforded to the Commission’s staff.

57s OCC voluntarily conducted and shared with the Commission’s staff the results of
an internal investigation conducted by a third party. OCC provided documents and information
regarding the key issues and events that significantly advanced the staff's investigation and
conserved Commission resources. OCC executives voluntarily met with Commission staff to
discuss OCC’s root cause analysis regarding its failure to incorporate the LC Charge into its
Clearing Fund methodologies and its related remediation efforts, and to answer questions from the
Commission’s staff.

58. In addition, OCC has taken and completed several remedial steps including, but not
limited to, engaging an outside consultant to review its remediation efforts regarding incorporating
the LC Charge into its Clearing Fund methodologies and to conduct a review of OCC’s
overarching risk management framework and governance. OCC has provided regular updates to
the Commission staff regarding its remedial efforts.

Undertakings

59. Respondent has undertaken to engage in the remedial measures set forth in its
January 30, 2023 Remediation Plan letter (the “Remediation Plan letter”) to the Commission staff.
These remedial measures include, but are not limited to, revising its model validation policies and
procedures; enhancing its approach to risk data governance; and implementing changes to elements
of its control environment, including processes, procedures, and controls, and conducting
appropriate training on the changes. To the extent any such remedial measures require a filing
under Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act or Section 806(e) of the Dodd-Frank Act, no later than 30

policies and procedures to account for the liquidity needs associated with the payment required to
effect the transfer of the guaranty as contemplated by the Accord, using historical data provided by
the correspondent clearing corporation to Respondent, and to include the results of this process in
Respondent’s existing liquidity stress testing practices. This filing shall be made in consultation
with and in a manner not unacceptable to staff of the Division of Trading and Markets and
consistent with the prioritized, three-tiered list of planned filings in Paragraph 61. All remaining

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Laidlaw & Company (UK) Ltd. (Laidlaw) submits
this Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement
of the alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND

Laidlaw has been a FINRA member since July 2002. Laidlaw maintains eight branch
offices, employs approximately 75 registered representatives, and operates a full-service
brokerage business. !

OVERVIEW

Laidlaw conducted a securities business while failing to maintain the required minimum
net capital during four periods between February 2018 and July 2022. As a result,
Respondent violated Section 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
15c3-1 thereunder, and FINRA Rules 4110(b) and 2010.

During those periods, Laidlaw also failed to timely file required notices of net capital
deficiency with the SEC and FINRA. Further, on March 8, 2019, Laidlaw filed an
inaccurate notice of net capital deficiency. As a result, Respondent violated Section 17(a)
of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 17a-11(b) thereunder, and FINRA Rule
2010.

Further, Laidlaw failed to maintain accurate books and records concerning its net capital
position between January 2018, and July 2022, and filed 24 inaccurate Financial and

Operational Combined Uniform Single (FOCUS) reports between January 2018 and July
2022. As a result, Laidlaw violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act
Rule 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder, and FINRA Rules 4511 and 2010.

Additionally, between February 2018 and January 2019, Laidlaw’s supervisory system,
including written supervisory procedures, was not reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with FINRA Rule 2111 in connection with the due diligence private
placement offerings. By virtue of the foregoing, Laidlaw violated FINRA Rules 3110 and
2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
This matter originated from cycle examinations of Laidlaw.

The firm conducted a securities business while it failed to maintain the required net
capital.

Exchange Act § 15(c) and Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1 prohibit a broker-dealer from
engaging in a securities business if its net capital falls below a certain amount. FINRA
Rule 4110(b6)(1) provides that a member shall suspend all business operations during any
period in which it is not in compliance with applicable net capital requirements. A
violation of Exchange Act § 15(c), Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1, or FINRA Rule 4110(b)
also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010, which provides that a FINRA member, “in the
conduct of its business, shall observe high standards of commercial honor and just and
equitable principles of trade.”

The firm’s net capital deficiencies occurred during four periods between February 2018
and July 2022. During all of these periods, the firm’s required minimum net capital
ranged between approximately $100,000 and approximately $240,000.

First, the firm’s net capital fell below the required minimum amount on February 28,
2018, and remained below the minimum amount through May 31, 2018, with deficiencies
ranging from $117, 242 to $427,379. The net capital deficiencies occurred because, as of
at least January 26, 2018, the firm improperly included a certificate of deposit in its net
capital computation as an allowable asset, even though that certificate of deposit served
as collateral for a line of credit.

Second, the firm’s net capital again fell below the required minimum amount on
December 31, 2018, and remained below the minimum amount through May 31, 2019,
with deficiencies ranging from $22,792 to $944,526. These net capital deficiencies
resulted from the improper treatment of several items in the firm’s net capital
computations. First, the firm continued to improperly include the above-referenced
certificate of deposit as an allowable asset despite it serving as collateral. In addition, the
firm improperly included certain receivables, most of which were fees for investment
banking services as allowable assets, even though they were unsecured, outstanding for
over 30 days and not offset by a payable liability at the time they were included. The firm
also improperly included a non-marketable convertible note as an allowable asset without

2

converting the note into shares of the issuer. Finally, the firm included the value of a
warrant held by the firm as an allowable asset prior to the firm’s exercise of the warrant
and deposit of the associated shares of an issuer (Company A).

Third, on 15 days between December 18, 2019, and March 20, 2020, the firm’s net
capital fell below the required minimum amount, with deficiencies ranging from $71,864
to $1,355,463. On 12 of those days, the firm conducted a securities business. This
occurred because the firm failed to take a deduction for non-marketable shares of
Company A that it had received on December 18, 2019. Exchange Act Rule 15c3-
1(c)(2)(vii)(1) provides that, when the marketplace can absorb only a limited number of
shares of a security for which a ready market seemingly exists, the non-marketable
portion of a position is subject to a 100% deduction and should be treated as a non-
allowable asset. The Rule provides that the number of shares exceeding the aggregate of
the most recent four-week inter-dealer trading volume should be considered non-
marketable. The firm failed to identify instances in which the prior four-week aggregate
trading volume of Company A stock exceeded the amount of Company A shares held by
the firm, thereby requiring the firm to take a 100% deduction on that non-marketable
portion of its position.

Finally, the firm’s net capital again fell below the required minimum amount on February
28, 2022, and remained below the minimum amount through July 21, 2022, with
deficiencies ranging from $286,300 to $1,631,229. These net capital deficiencies
occurred because the firm improperly excluded its obligations under a lease agreement
from its net capital calculations.

Therefore, the firm violated Exchange Act § 15(c), Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1, and
FINRA Rules 4110(b) and 2010.

|
Laidlaw failed to file timely and accurate notices of net capital deficiency.

Exchange Act § 17(a) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-11(b) require a FINRA member
whose net capital declines below the minimum amount required under Exchange Rule
15c3-1 to give notice of its net capital deficiency that same day to FINRA and the SEC,
including the current amount of its net capital deficiency. A violation of Exchange Act §
17(a) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-11 also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

On March 8, 2019, the firm filed a Rule 17a-11(b) Financial Notification with the SEC
and FINRA that incorrectly stated its net capital position. While the filing identified that
the firm had overstated its net capital from December 31, 2018, through February 27,
2019, due to its treatment of the above-referenced certificate of deposit as an allowable
asset, the filing inaccurately understated the extent of the firm’s net capital deficiencies.
Specifically, the filing did not reflect the deficiencies caused by any of the other improper
computations that occurred during this period, as discussed above.

Additionally, between February 28, 2022, and July 21, 2022, despite receiving inquiries
from FINRA about the firm’s net capital deficiencies, the firm failed to file timely notices
of net capital deficiencies.

Therefore, Laidlaw violated Exchange Act § 17(a) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-11(b) and
FINRA Rule 2010.

Laidlaw failed to maintain accurate books and records.

Exchange Act § 17(a), Exchange Act Rule 17a-3, and FINRA Rule 4511 require FINRA
member firms to make and keep accurate books and records, including net capital
calculations. Exchange Act § 17(a) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-5 require FINRA
member firms to timely file accurate FOCUS reports. A violation of Exchange Act

§ 17(a), Exchange Act Rule 17a-3, Exchange Act Rule 17a-5, and FINRA Rule 4511 is
also a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

Respondent failed to maintain accurate books and records concerning its net capital
position between January 26, 2018, and July 21, 2022. Additionally, Respondent filed 24
inaccurate FOCUS reports between January 2018 and July 2022 that overstated the
amount of the firm’s net capital and excess net capital.

Therefore, Laidlaw violated Exchange Act § 17(a), Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5,
and FINRA Rules 4511 and 2010.

Laidlaw’s supervisory system was not reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with FINRA rules governing private placement due diligence.

FINRA Rule 3110(a) requires a member firm to establish and maintain a system to
supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA
rules. FINRA Rule 3110(b) requires a member firm to establish, maintain, and enforce
written procedures to supervise the types of business in which it engages and the
activities of its associated persons that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA Rules. A
violation of FINRA Rule 3110 also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

FINRA Regulatory Notice 10-22 reminded broker-dealers of their obligation to conduct a
reasonable investigation of the issuer and the securities they recommend in private
placements under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933. A firm’s obligation to
investigate is based on the suitability requirements of FINRA Rule 2111, which provides
that a firm must have reasonable grounds to believe that a recommendation to purchase,
sell or exchange a security is suitable for the customer. To satisfy “reasonable basis”
suitability, a firm must have a reasonable basis to believe, based on a reasonable
investigation, that the security is suitable for some investors. Regulatory Notice 10-22
provides that firms must have supervisory procedures that are reasonably designed to
ensure, among other itis, that the firm’s personnel investigate each private placement
the firm recommends and that they do so in a manner that is sufficiently rigorous to
comply with legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, Regulatory Notice 10-22
provides that firms should retain records documenting both the process and results of
their investigations,

Between February 2018 and January 2019, the firm maintained written supervisory
procedures (WSPs) requiring its representatives, when engaging in Regulation D
offerings, to conduct a reasonable investigation of the issuer and its management, and to
document their due diligence reviews and investigations. However, the firm did not
provide any guidance regarding how representatives should document due diligence
reviews, or who was responsible for ensuring that the firm had done so.

In connection with three private placements the firm recommended to customers between
February 2018 and January 2019, the firm failed to conduct and document reasonable
investigation of the offerings. Specifically, the firm served as placement agent for a
private placement offering by an educational technology company (Offering A). Rather
than conducting an independent investigation, the firm relied almost exclusively on
documentation and information the issuer provided. The firm’s due diligence file for
Offering A contained documents provided by the issuer, but did not contain any evidence
that the firm reviewed or analyzed those documents or conducted any other review of the
issuer or its management. Additionally, the firm sent the issuer a “due diligence
checklist” requesting various information and documents, but the firm did not receive a
completed checklist or document that it had otherwise received the requested information
from the issuer or performed any analysis of that information. The firm also served as the
introducing broker for two private placement offerings by biotechnology companies
(Offering B and Offering C). As with Offering A, the firm relied almost exclusively on
documentation and information the issuers of Offerings B and C provided, and the firm’s
due diligence files did not contain evidence that the firm reviewed any of the documents
it received in connection with the offerings or that it conducted any other reviews of the
issuers or their management.

Therefore, Laidlaw|violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:

L

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that cease-

Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Candlestick Capital Management LP
(“Candlestick Capital” or “Respondent’’).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer’”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-
and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds! that:

Summary

1. These proceedings concern Candlestick Capital’s violation of Rule 105 of
Regulation M [17 C.F.R. § 242.105] (“Rule 105”).? On June 16, 2020, Candlestick Capital sold
short common stock of American Airlines Group Inc. (“American Airlines”) within Rule 105’s
restricted period in the accounts of two of its private fund clients, Candlestick Master Fund LP and
Candlestick US F&F Fund LP (together, the “Funds’’). Candlestick Capital then purchased shares
of American Airlines common stock for the Funds in a follow-on offering from a participating
underwriter, without qualifying for an exception from the prohibition in Rule 105. As a result,
Candlestick Capital violated Rule 105. Candlestick Capital’s conduct resulted in ill-gotten gains to
the Funds of $1,620,398.50.

2. Rule 105 makes it unlawful for a person to purchase equity securities from an
underwriter, broker or dealer participating in a covered public offering if that person sold short the
security that is the subject of the offering during the restricted period as defined in the rule, absent
an exception. 17 C.F.R. § 242.105; see Short Selling in Connection with a Public Offering, Rel.
No. 34-56206, 72 Fed. Reg. 45094 (Aug. 10, 2007) (effective Oct. 9, 2007). The Rule 105
“restricted period” is the shorter of the period: (1) beginning five business days before the pricing
of the offered securities and ending with such pricing; or (2) beginning with the initial filing of a
registration statement or notification on Exchange Act Form 1-A or 1-E and ending with pricing.
17 C.F.R. § 242.105(a)(1) and (a)(2).

3. Generally, the offering prices of secondary and follow-on offerings are set at a
discount to the stock’s closing price just prior to pricing.

4. The Commission adopted Rule 105 “to foster secondary and follow-on offering
prices that are determined by independent market dynamics and not by potentially manipulative
activity.” 72 Fed. Reg. 45094. Rule 105 is prophylactic and prohibits the conduct irrespective of
the short seller’s intent in effecting the short sale. Id.

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

? Candlestick Capital has separately consented to an order to pay a $810,000 penalty and the
Funds, as relief defendants, have separately consented to orders to pay a combined total of
$1,712,985.69 in disgorgement and prejudgement interest in the previously filed United States
District Court case SEC v. Candlestick Capital Management LP et al., Civ. Action No. 3:23-cv-
00206 (D. Conn. 2023), which concerns the same Rule 105 violation alleged in this Order.

2.

5. Rule 105 provides an exception for a “bona fide purchase,” which generally does
not prohibit a person from purchasing securities in an offering even if they sold short during the
Rule 105 restricted period as long as they purchase the same security in at least the same amount as
they sold short during the restricted period before the offering is priced. The restricted period
purchase must satisfy the following requirements in order to qualify as a “bona fide purchase”
under Rule 105: (i) the purchase is at least equivalent in quantity to the entire amount of the Rule
105 restricted period short sale(s); (ii) the purchase is effected during regular trading hours; (iii) the
purchase is reported to an effective transaction reporting plan (as defined in Rule 600(b)(22) of
Regulation NMS); (iv) the purchase is effected after the last Rule 105 restricted period short sale,
and no later than the business day prior to the day of pricing; and (v) the person did not effect a
short sale that was reported to an effective transaction reporting plan within the 30 minutes prior to
the close of regular trading hours (as defined in Rule 600(b)(64) of Regulation NMS) on the
business day prior to the day of pricing. 17 C.F.R. § 242.105(b). The requirements of the bona
fide purchase exception are designed to ensure transparency of the activity to the market so that the
effects of the purchase can be reflected in the security’s market price prior to the pricing of the
offering. See 72 Fed. Reg. 45094, 45097.

Respondent

6. Candlestick Capital Management LP is a limited partnership organized under the
laws of Delaware and located in Greenwich, Connecticut. Candlestick Capital is registered with
the Commission as an investment adviser and advises the Funds, among other private fund clients.
Candlestick Capital has represented that, as of October 31, 2022, it had approximately $3 billion in
assets under management.

Facts

7 On Tuesday, June 16, 2020, Candlestick Capital sold short a combined total of
350,000 shares of American Airlines common stock at an average price of $17.62891 per share in
the Funds’ accounts.

8. On Sunday, June 21, 2020, American Airlines filed a preliminary prospectus
supplement to a shelf registration statement previously filed on February 19, 2020, for a follow-on
offering of its common stock to be priced after the market closed on Monday, June 22, 2020 (the
“Offering”).

9. On Monday, June 22, 2020, the day the Offering was priced, Candlestick Capital
recognized that the Funds’ June 16, 2020 short sale of American Airlines common stock fell within
the restricted period and that the Funds could not participate in the Offering absent a valid
exception. Candlestick Capital purchased a combined total of 350,000 shares of American Airlines
common stock in the Funds’ accounts in the open market, during regular trading hours, in a failed
attempt to fall within the terms of the bona fide purchase exception to Rule 105.

10. After the market closed on Monday, June 22, 2020, American Airlines priced the
Offering at $13.50 per share.

11. The short sales that Candlestick Capital effected for the Funds occurred within the
Rule 105 restricted period, which ran from Tuesday, June 16, 2020 through Monday, June 22,
2020.

12. For the Funds to meet the requirements of the Rule 105 bona fide purchase
exception, they would have had to purchase at least 350,000 shares of American Airlines common
stock in the open market, during regular trading hours, by the market close on Friday, June 19,
2020.

13. Shortly after market close on Monday, June 22, 2020, Candlestick Capital
submitted an indication of interest to a participating underwriter on behalf of the Funds to purchase
750,000 shares in the Offering. Later that evening, certain Candlestick Capital personnel raised
concerns that Candlestick Capital may have failed to meet the conditions of the Rule 105 bona fide
purchase exception.

14. On Tuesday, June 23, 2020, Candlestick Capital nevertheless received an allocation
of 750,000 shares in the Offering. Later that day, Candlestick Capital determined that it had failed
to meet the bona fide purchase exception and that it violated Rule 105 by purchasing shares in the
Offering in the Funds’ accounts.

15. The difference between the price at which the Funds sold short 350,000 shares of
American Airlines common stock during the restricted period and the price at which the Funds
purchased 350,000 shares in the Offering was $1,445,118.50.

16. The Funds also improperly received a benefit of $175,280 by purchasing the
incremental 400,000 Offering shares at a discount from American Airlines’ market price.

17. Thus, the Funds received total profits of $1,620,398.50 by participating in the
Offering.

18. Upon concluding that it had violated Rule 105, Candlestick Capital did not self-
report the violation to the Commission. Candlestick Capital also did not conduct a formal review
of its trading history to identify other possible Rule 105 violations, although at the time
Candlestick Capital had participated in a limited number of offerings. A subsequent review
conducted by Candlestick Capital in response to the Commission staff's investigation in 2022
identified no other Rule 105 violations.

19. In addition, Candlestick Capital did not accurately document the Rule 105 violation
in its books and records and only acknowledged the Rule 105 violation after the Commission staff
specifically asked about it during a routine examination of Candlestick Capital in 2021.

20. Candlestick Capital has since undertaken certain remedial steps, including updating
and revising its Rule 105 policies and procedures to prevent future Rule 105 violations, including
related to the bona fide purchase exception.

21. As a result of the conduct described above, Candlestick Capital violated Rule 105
of Regulation M under the Exchange Act [17 C.F.R. § 242.105].

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent Candlestick Capital’s Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act,

Respondent Candlestick Capital cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any
future violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act.

By the Commission.

Vanessa A. Countryman
Secretary
","The SEC found that Candlestick Capital Management violated Rule 105 of Regulation M by selling short shares of American Airlines stock within the restricted period before a follow-on offering, and then purchasing shares in the offering. Candlestick failed to qualify for the bona fide purchase exception. As a result, Candlestick's private fund clients obtained over $1.6 million in improper profits. Candlestick consented to the SEC's cease-and-desist order without admitting or denying the findings. Candlestick also agreed to pay an $810,000 penalty in a parallel case, while its funds agreed to pay over $1.7 million in disgorgement and interest."

Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds! that:

Summary

1. These proceedings concern the violation of Rule 105 of Regulation M [17 C.F.R. §
242.105] (“Rule 105”) by HITE.? On May 7, 2021, HITE sold short common stock of Pioneer
Natural Resources Company (“Pioneer”) in the accounts of the following private fund clients:
HITE Hedge Energy LP, HITE Hedge LP, HITE Hedge Offshore Ltd., HITE Hedge QP LP, and
HITE MLP LP (collectively, the “Funds”). On May 10, 2021, within Rule 105’s restricted period,
HITE purchased shares of Pioneer common stock for the Funds in a secondary offering from a
participating underwriter, without qualifying for an exception from the prohibition in Rule 105.
HITE’s conduct resulted in ill-gotten gains to the Funds of $111,629.52.

2. Rule 105 makes it unlawful for a person to purchase equity securities from an
underwriter, broker or dealer participating in a covered public offering if that person sold short the
security that is the subject of the offering during the restricted period as defined in the rule, absent
an exception. 17 C.F.R. § 242.105; see Short Selling in Connection with a Public Offering, Rel.
No. 34-56206, 72 Fed. Reg. 45094 (Aug. 10, 2007) (effective Oct. 9, 2007). The Rule 105
“restricted period” is the shorter of the period: (1) beginning five business days before the pricing

3. The Commission adopted Rule 105 “to foster secondary and follow-on offering

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

HITE has separately consented to an order to pay a $103,591 penalty and certain of its private
fund clients, as relief defendants, have separately consented to orders to pay a combined total of
$116,566.76 in disgorgement and prejudgement interest in the previously filed United States
District Court case SEC v. HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC et al., Civ. Action No. 1:23-cv-
10351 (D. Mass. 2023), which concerns the same Rule 105 violation alleged in this Order.

2.

Hedge Offshore Ltd., among other private fund clients. As of December 31, 2021, HITE had
approximately $1.55 billion in regulatory assets under management.

Facts

5. On Friday, May 7, 2021, HITE sold short a combined total of 17,428 shares of
Pioneer common stock at an average price of $167.83 per share in the Funds’ accounts.

6. On Monday, May 10, 2021, Pioneer filed a preliminary prospectus supplement to a
shelf registration statement previously filed on August 5, 2020 for a secondary offering of its
common stock to be priced after the market closed on Monday, May 10, 2021 (the “Offering’’).

Ts On the same day, HITE received several messages from a participating underwriter
notifying HITE about the Offering and soliciting HITE to participate in the Offering. One message
referred to the Offering as a “block trade.” A second message described the Offering as a “100%
secondary” offering, and stated that participants represented their eligibility to receive an allocation
in accordance with Rule 105 by submitting an order for an allocation in the Offering.

8. After the market closed on Monday, May 10, 2021, Pioneer priced the Offering at
$161 per share.

9. The short sales that HITE effected for the Funds occurred within the Rule 105
restricted period, which ran from Tuesday, May 4, 2021 through Monday, May 10, 2021.

10. HITE did not have any formal written policies relating to Rule 105. However,
HITE’s former Chief Compliance Officer (““CCO”) implemented a practice whereby traders were
required to seek the CCO’s written approval prior to participating in any public offering.

11. Consistent with that general practice, HITE’s trader sought and obtained approval
to participate in the Offering from the CCO.

12. The CCO approved HITE’s participation in the Offering because he mistakenly
believed that Rule 105 did not apply to the Offering.

13. HITE then submitted an indication of interest to a participating underwriter on
behalf of the Funds to purchase 20,000 shares in the Offering after market close on Monday, May
10, 2021.

14. On Tuesday, May 11, 2021, HITE received an allocation of 20,000 shares in the
Offering in the Funds’ accounts.

15. The difference between the price at which the Funds sold short shares of Pioneer
common stock during the restricted period and the price at which the Funds purchased an equal
number of shares in the Offering was $111,629.52.

16. Thus, the Funds received $111,629.52 in total profits by participating in the
Offering, of which $33,767.52 was received by HITE Energy LP, $14,650.35 was received by
HITE Hedge LP, $53,417.43 was received by HITE Hedge Offshore Ltd., $6,208.47 was received
by HITE Hedge QP LP, and $3,585.75 was received by HITE MLP LP.

17. In June 2022, HITE consolidated the assets of (1) HITE Hedge QP LP into HITE
Energy LP, which was subsequently renamed as HITE Hedge II LP; and (2) HITE MLP LP into
HITE Hedge LP. Asa result of the consolidation, HITE Hedge LP received an additional
$3,585.75 for a total of $18,236.10 in ill-gotten gains, HITE Hedge II LP received an additional
$33,767.52 for a total of $39,975.99 in total ill-gotten gains, and HITE Hedge Offshore Ltd
received $53,417.43 in ill-gotten gains.

18. On September 21, 2021, a participating underwriter notified HITE that HITE
participated in the Offering after selling short shares of Pioneer during the restricted period in
possible violation of Rule 105.

19. Upon being informed of its purchase within Rule 105’s restricted period, HITE did
not conduct a review of its prior trading history to identify other possible Rule 105 violations and
did not implement a written Rule 105 policy or otherwise enhance its compliance measures related
to Rule 105 at that time.

20. During the course of the Commission staff’s investigation, HITE implemented a
written Rule 105 policy and conducted a subsequent review of its trading history, which identified
no other Rule 105 violations. HITE also replaced its CCO in November 2021 and hired an
additional compliance staff member in June 2022.

21. As a result of the conduct described above, HITE violated Rule 105 of Regulation
M under the Exchange Act [17 C.F.R. § 242.105].

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent HITE’s Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act,

Respondent HITE cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future
violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act.

By the Commission.

Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offer, the Commission finds that:

Summary

1. Respondents Huntleigh and Datatex, both registered investment advisers affiliated
by common ownership, breached their fiduciary duty to advisory clients in connection with
compensation that Huntleigh and Respondents’ affiliated broker-dealer received as a result of the
advisory clients’ investments. From at least September 2015 through 2022 (the “Relevant Period”),
Respondents failed to provide full and fair disclosure regarding their conflicts of interest associated
with: (a) compensation Huntleigh received based on client transaction fees; (b) revenue Huntleigh
and Respondents’ affiliated broker-dealer Huntleigh Securities Corp. (“HSC”) received in
connection with advisory client cash sweep accounts; and (c) HSC’s receipt of fees pursuant to Rule
12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (““12b-1 fees”) from clients’ investments in
certain mutual fund share classes, including when lower-cost, non fee-paying share classes were
also available. Respondents, although eligible to do so, did not self-report to the Commission,
pursuant to the Division of Enforcement’s Share Class Selection Disclosure Initiative.' Huntleigh
further failed to provide full and fair disclosure regarding its conflicts of interest associated with
revenue HSC and Huntleigh received based on the rate of margin interest charged to advisory
clients.

2. Respondents also breached their duty of care, including their duty to seek best
execution, by: (a) failing to evaluate whether Huntleigh’s receipt of advisory client transaction fees
from HSC, impacted the reasonableness of the fees HSC charged the advisory clients or whether
Huntleigh clients were receiving best execution; (b) failing to periodically evaluate whether the
default sweep account was the best option for their clients; and (c) recommending clients invest in
share classes of mutual funds that paid 12b-1 fees and failing to evaluate whether continuing to hold
such share classes best served their clients’ interests when share classes of the same funds were
available to the clients that presented a more favorable value for these clients based on their
particular circumstances.

3h In addition, Respondents failed to adopt and implement written compliance policies
and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act and the rules
thereunder in connection with disclosure of their conflicts of interest, best execution, and mutual
fund share class selection.

Respondents

4. Huntleigh, incorporated in Missouri and headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, has
been registered with the Commission as an investment adviser since 2004. In its Form ADV dated

' See Div. of Enforcement, U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, Share Class Selection Disclosure Initiative,
https://www.sec.gov/enforce/announcement/scsd-initiative (last modified Feb. 12, 2018).

2.

March 28, 2022, Huntleigh reported that it had approximately $486 million in regulatory assets
under management.

5. Datatex, incorporated in Missouri and headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, has been
registered with the Commission as an investment adviser since 1988. In its Form ADV dated
March 28, 2022, Datatex reported that it had approximately $38.99 million in regulatory assets
under management. Datatex is registered as a related adviser under Rule 203A-2(b) based on its
affiliation with Huntleigh.

Related Entity

6. HSC, incorporated in Missouri and headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, has been
registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer since 1977. HSC shares common ownership,
management, and employees with Huntleigh and Datatex, and is under common control with
Huntleigh and Datatex. HSC, Huntleigh, and Datatex employ representatives that are registered
representatives of HSC as well as investment adviser representatives (“IARs”) of Huntleigh and
Datatex.

Background

7. Respondents provide investment advisory services primarily on a discretionary basis
to individuals, but also to organizations. During the Relevant Period, Respondents primarily used
HSC as an introducing broker-dealer for their advised accounts, and HSC cleared through an
unaffiliated clearing broker (“Clearing Broker’) pursuant to a Fully Disclosed Clearing Agreement
(“Clearing Agreement”).

8. During the Relevant Period, a portion of Datatex’s advisory client accounts were
sub-advised by Huntleigh (““Sub-Advised Accounts’). As sub-adviser for these accounts, Huntleigh
was responsible for selecting investments and placing trades for the accounts.

9. HSC, Huntleigh, and Datatex shared office space, officers, employees, and
representatives, and thus many of their business expenses were shared. HSC and Huntleigh entered
into two Expense Co-Sharing Agreements (“Expense Agreements”), one in June 2015 and another
in August 2019, under which HSC and Huntleigh allocated certain business expenses between the
firms.

Transaction Fees

10. The Clearing Agreement between HSC and Clearing Broker set forth, among other
things, a pricing schedule that detailed the fees HSC paid the Clearing Broker for providing
execution, clearing, and custody for HSC’s brokerage customers, including the advisory clients of
Respondents. In September 2015, the Clearing Broker charged HSC a per-trade clearing fee that
varied based on the asset traded as well as a $1.00 per trade confirm handling fee. The Clearing
Agreement also allowed HSC to instruct the Clearing Broker to charge the brokerage customers

(including Respondents’ advisory clients) a “transaction fee,” most of which the Clearing Broker
would pay to HSC.

11. Throughout the Relevant Period, Respondents represented to clients in their Forms
ADV Part 2A (“Brochures’’) that clients would be responsible for certain fees and expenses charged
by custodians and imposed by broker-dealers including, but not limited to, transaction fees, but that
the adviser would be responsible for paying execution and clearing charges to the Clearing Broker.
Huntleigh’s advisory agreement reiterated that Huntleigh would pay execution and clearing charges,
but Datatex’s advisory agreement contradicted Datatex’s Brochure and stated that the clients may
pay these charges. Respondents’ disclosures did not explain what a “transaction fee’ was as
opposed to execution and clearing charges, or when clients would be responsible for transaction
fees. Further, Respondents did not disclose that it was their affiliate, HSC, that determined the
amount of such transaction fees, or that Respondents financially benefited. For the Sub-Advised
Accounts, Huntleigh paid the execution and clearing charges instead of Datatex. From at least
September 2015 through mid-September 2018, Huntleigh paid HSC per-trade clearing and
execution fees generally between $7.25 and $13.00, depending on the investment product. HSC
then remitted these payments to the Clearing Broker.

12. During the Relevant Period, the Clearing Broker, at HSC’s instruction pursuant to
the Clearing Agreement, typically charged a $5.75 transaction fee to brokerage customers, including
Respondents’ advisory clients. HSC used $1.00 of each transaction fee to pay the confirm handling
fee that HSC owed under the Clearing Agreement and credited the remaining $4.75 to HSC’s
account. HSC then credited the $4.75 from the client transaction fees to Huntleigh pursuant to the
Expense Agreements, which reduced the net cost to Huntleigh when its clients and the Sub-Advised
Accounts executed trades. Huntleigh recorded the credits as revenue.

13. In September 2018, HSC instructed the Clearing Broker to increase the client
transaction fee by one dollar to $6.75 based on HSC’s belief that the transaction fees charged by
HSC were below industry standards. HSC passed this additional revenue on to Huntleigh by
increasing Huntleigh’s corresponding credit pursuant to the Expense Agreements by one dollar to
$5.75. The Clearing Broker’s clearing and execution fees, however, remained the same.
Respondents failed to evaluate whether they were continuing to obtain best execution for clients in
light of the increase.

14. In October 2019, the Clearing Broker eliminated the $1.00 confirm handling fee it
charged HSC out of each transaction fee, and HSC began crediting the entire $6.75 client
transaction fee to Huntleigh.

15. As investment advisers, Respondents were obligated to disclose all material facts to
their advisory clients, including any conflicts of interest between themselves and their clients that
could affect to the advisory relationship. To meet this fiduciary obligation, Respondents were
required to provide their clients with full and fair disclosure that was sufficiently specific so that the
clients could understand the conflicts of interest concerning Respondents’ advice and have an
informed basis on which to consent to or reject the conflicts.

16. Huntleigh’s and Datatex’s disclosures were inadequate and misleading. None of the
Respondents’ disclosures to clients explained what a “transaction fee” was as opposed to execution
and clearing charges, or when clients would be responsible for transaction fees. Respondents did
not disclose that it was their affiliate, HSC, that decided to impose the transaction fee and the
amount of the fee. Respondents also did not disclose to their clients that Huntleigh and HSC
entered into Expense Agreements, that Huntleigh received credits derived from the transaction fees
that Respondents’ clients paid, or the associated conflicts of interest resulting from Huntleigh
receiving revenue related to client trades. To the contrary, Huntleigh disclosed that
“{a]pproximately 100% of [Respondents’] revenue is generated from advisory fees” and that they
“disclose to clients the existence of all material conflicts of interest, including the potential for our
firm and our employees to earn compensation from advisory clients in addition to our firm’s
advisory fees.”

17. Respondents’ fiduciary duty also includes, among other things, a duty of care. To
fulfill this obligation, an adviser, among other things, must provide investment advice in the best
interest of its client based on the client’s objectives and seek best execution for client transactions?

18. Respondents violated their duty to seek best execution on behalf of their clients by
placing client transactions with HSC without evaluating whether HSC’s transaction fees were
reasonable in light of Huntleigh’s arrangement with HSC to credit most of the fees to Huntleigh.
Respondents also failed to reevaluate whether their clients were receiving best execution when: (a)
HSC decided to increase the transaction fees in September 2018 and credit those additional fees to
Huntleigh, and when (b) HSC decided to maintain the $6.75 transaction fee in October 2019 despite
a $1.00 per trade reduction in fees charged by the Clearing Broker, instead passing the cost savings
on to Huntleigh in the form of increased credits rather than reducing what clients paid.

Cash Sweep Revenue Sharing

19. When Respondents’ clients opened an HSC brokerage account, Respondents or the
clients selected a cash sweep vehicle into which uninvested cash balances would be directed (the
“Sweep Account”). A Sweep Account is used by broker-dealers to hold cash (e.g., incoming cash
deposits, dividends, or certain investment returns) until the investor or its adviser decides how to
invest the money.

20. During the Relevant Period, the Clearing Broker offered certain Sweep Account
options. The Sweep Accounts varied by type of vehicle (money market fund or FDIC-insured bank
deposit account). For some Sweep Accounts, the Clearing Broker agreed to pay a portion of any
revenue it received from the Sweep Account sponsor to financial firms whose clients or customers
used the Sweep Account. For other Sweep Accounts, the Clearing Broker did not pay any revenue
sharing.

21. During the Relevant Period, Respondents used FDIC-insured bank deposit accounts
(the “Deposit Accounts’) as the default Sweep Account for Huntleigh’s advisory clients and the

? See, e.g., Interpretive Release Concerning the Scope of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(“Exchange Act”) and Related Matters, Exchange Act Rel. No. 23170 (Apr. 28, 1986).

5

Sub-Advised Accounts. Pursuant to the Clearing Agreement, the Clearing Broker made variable
monthly payments to HSC of up to an annual rate of 0.70% of the aggregate assets Respondents’
clients held in the Deposit Accounts. From September 2015 through August 2019, HSC credited
this revenue to Huntleigh pursuant to the June 2015 Expense Agreement.

22. Respondents failed to disclose to clients, in their Forms ADV or otherwise, HSC’s
receipt of cash sweep revenue sharing payments, Huntleigh’s receipt of credits from HSC for these
payments, or the attendant conflicts of interest, including that Respondents recommended Sweep
Account options that yielded revenue sharing over other options that did not result in revenue
sharing.

23. HSC provided to clients a document prepared by the Clearing Broker about the
Clearing Broker’s cash sweep program. This document described the revenue sharing program and
the introducing firm’s interest in the various Sweep Account options. This document did not make
clear that the introducing firm was HSC, did not address that Respondents as the clients’ advisers
had a conflict of interest, and did not disclose that Huntleigh was profiting from the relationship.

24. Respondents also violated their duty of care by failing to periodically evaluate
whether the default Deposit Accounts were the best options for their clients based on their
objectives or whether other options that did not yield revenue for HSC and Huntleigh, and at times
offered higher yields, were in clients’ best interests. Pursuant to their advisory agreements,
Respondents agreed to provide “continuous investment management” for clients in accordance with
(a) the clients’ objectives and express written guidelines, and (b) the Respondents’ investment
strategy as set forth in the Respondents’ Brochures, including investing and re-investing assets, and
therefore had an obligation to evaluate whether remaining in the Deposit Accounts continued to be
in the clients’ best interest.

Mutual Fund Share Class Selection

25; Mutual funds typically offer investors different types of shares or “share classes.”
Each share class represents an interest in the same portfolio of securities with the same investment
objective. The primary difference among the share classes is the fee structure.

26. For example, some mutual fund share classes charge 12b-1 fees to cover certain
costs of fund distribution and sometimes shareholder services. These recurring fees, which are
included in a mutual fund’s total annual fund operating expenses, vary by share class, but typically
range from 25 to 100 basis points. They are deducted from the mutual fund’s assets on an ongoing
basis and paid to the fund’s distributor or principal underwriter, which generally remits the 12b-1
fees to the broker-dealer that distributed or sold the shares.

27. Many mutual funds also offer share classes that do not charge 12b-1 fees (e.g.,
“Institutional Class” or “Class I” shares (collectively, “Class I shares”)).>_ An investor who holds

3 Share classes that do not charge 12b-1 fees also go by a variety of other names in the mutual fund industry, such as
“Class F2,” “Class Y,” and “Class Z” shares. As used in this Order, the term “Class I shares” refers generically to
share classes that do not charge 12b-1 fees.

Class I shares of a mutual fund will usually pay lower total annual fund operating expenses over
time—and thus will generally earn higher returns—than one who holds a share class of the same
fund that charges 12b-1 fees. Therefore, if a mutual fund offers a Class I share, and an investor is
eligible to own it, it is often, though not always, better for the investor to purchase or hold the Class
I share.

28. During the Relevant Period, Respondents advised clients to purchase or hold* mutual
fund share classes that charged 12b-1 fees, including when lower-cost share classes of those same
funds were available to those clients. These 12b-1 fees were paid to HSC, which in most cases
would not have collected them had Respondents’ advisory clients been invested in the available
lower-cost share classes.

29. During the Relevant Period, Respondents disclosed in their advisory contracts that
they or their affiliates “may directly or indirectly receive Rule 12b-1 distribution fees, which will be
in addition to the management fees and normal brokerage fees ....” However, Respondents did not
disclose either the existence of a conflict of interest or all material facts regarding the conflict of
interest that arose when they invested advisory clients in a share class that would generate 12b-1 fee
revenue for HSC and/or its registered representatives while a share class of the same fund was
available that would not provide HSC with that additional compensation.

30. Respondents also failed to meet their duty of care. First, they failed to seek best
execution by causing certain advisory clients to invest in fund share classes that charged 12b-1 fees
when share classes of the same funds were available to the clients that presented a more favorable
value under the particular circumstances in place at the time of the transactions. Second,
Respondents failed to evaluate whether it was in their clients’ best interests to hold 12b-1 fee-paying
share classes on a continuing basis, when lower cost share classes of the same fund were available.
Pursuant to their advisory agreements, Respondents agreed to provide “continuous investment
management” for clients in accordance with (a) the clients’ objectives and express written
guidelines, and (b) the Respondents’ investment strategy as set forth in the Respondents’ Brochures,
including investing and re-investing assets, and therefore had an obligation to evaluate whether
remaining in the Deposit Accounts continued to be in the clients’ best interest.

Margin Interest

31. A margin account is a type of account in which a broker lends customers cash, using
the brokerage customer’s account as collateral, to purchase securities. The broker charges the
customer interest on the amount of money loaned by the broker to the investor in the margin
account (“Margin Interest’).

32. Since at least September 2015, Huntleigh recommended to certain of its advisory
clients that they enter into a margin account agreement with HSC and further recommended that
certain advisory clients use margin to purchase securities recommended by Huntleigh. The clients

4 In many cases, mutual funds permit certain advisory clients who hold shares in classes charging 12b-1 fees to
convert those shares to Class I shares without cost or tax consequences to the client.

7

paid Margin Interest on the amount of margin in the account. None of the Sub-Advised Accounts
used margin.

33, The Clearing Agreement provided that the Clearing Broker would charge interest to
HSC on the margin accounts of HSC’s brokerage customers, including those who were also
advisory clients of Huntleigh. The Clearing Agreement also provided that HSC may determine the
rate of interest the Clearing Broker would charge to HSC customers on the margin balance in the
margin accounts, and that HSC would earn the difference between the interest paid by HSC
customers and the interest paid by HSC to the Clearing Broker.

34. Since at least September 2015, HSC directed the Clearing Broker to charge Margin
Interest in excess of the amount HSC paid to the Clearing Broker, resulting in Huntleigh’s advisory
clients paying a higher Margin Interest with HSC receiving the additional interest. Depending on
the balance in a client’s margin account, HSC received as much as two-thirds of the Margin Interest
paid by clients. Until August 2019, HSC credited to Huntleigh the revenue that HSC derived from
Huntleigh advisory clients’ Margin Interest payments pursuant to the June 2015 Expense
Agreement. Beginning in September 2019, HSC stopped sharing with Huntleigh the revenue it
derived from advisory clients’ Margin Interest payments.

35% As a result, both HSC and Huntleigh received revenue on Huntleigh advisory client
accounts that they would not have collected had HSC not directed the Clearing Broker to charge
additional Margin Interest to advisory clients. The payments HSC received from the Clearing
Broker as well as the credits Huntleigh received from HSC each incentivized Huntleigh to
recommend margin accounts and to recommend clients buy securities that required the use of
margin.

36. Huntleigh did not provide full and fair disclosure to its advisory clients of its
conflicts of interest associated with HSC setting the margin interest rate charged to Huntleigh
advisory clients. The HSC brokerage account agreement disclosed that margin accounts would
charge interest and that the introducing firm (HSC) would set the interest rate. However, Huntleigh
failed to disclose its conflicts of interest with respect to margin, including that HSC received a
portion of the Margin Interest charged to clients or that it credited that revenue to Huntleigh for a
portion of the Relevant Period.

Compliance Deficiencies

37. During the Relevant Period, Respondents failed to adopt and implement written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act and the rules

thereunder in connection with (a) disclosure of conflicts of interest, and (b) investment selection,
including the selection of cash sweep products and mutual fund share class selection.

Violations

38. As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents Huntleigh and Datatex
willfully° violated Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act, which makes it unlawful for any investment
adviser, directly or indirectly, to “engage in any transaction, practice or course of business which
operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client.” Scienter is not required to
establish a violation of Section 206(2), but rather a violation may rest on a finding of negligence.
SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 643 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citing SEC v. Capital Gains Research
Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180,194-95 (1963)).

39. As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents Huntleigh and Datatex
willfully violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, which require a
registered investment adviser to adopt and implement written compliance policies and procedures
reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act and the rules thereunder.°

Disgorgement

40. The disgorgement and prejudgment interest ordered in paragraph IV.C is consistent
with equitable principles and does not exceed Respondent Huntleigh’s net profits from its
violations, and will be distributed to harmed investors to the extent feasible. Upon approval of the
distribution final accounting by the Commission, any amounts remaining that are infeasible to
return to investors, and any amounts returned to the Commission in the future that are infeasible to
return to investors, may be transferred to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, subject to Section
21F(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Undertakings
41. Respondents have undertaken to:

a. Within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order, Respondents shall review and
correct as necessary all relevant disclosure documents concerning transaction
fees and margin interest charged to their advisory clients, revenue sharing,
mutual fund share class selection, and best execution.

oe.

5 “willfully,” for purposes of imposing relief under Section 203(e) of the Advisers Act, ““means no more than that
the person charged with the duty knows what he is doing.’” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000)
(quoting Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949)). There is no requirement that the actor “also be aware
that he is violating one of the Rules or Acts.” Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965). The decision in The
Robare Group, Ltd. v. SEC, which construed the term “willfully” for purposes of a differently structured statutory
provision, does not alter that standard. 922 F.3d 468, 478-79 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (setting forth the showing required to
establish that a person has “willfully omit[ed]” material information from a required disclosure in violation of
Section 207 of the Advisers Act).

® Scienter is similarly not required to establish a violation of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act.

9

Within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order, Respondents shall evaluate
whether existing clients should be moved to a lower-cost share class or fund and
move clients as necessary.

Within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order, Respondents shall evaluate,
update (if necessary), and review for the effectiveness of their implementation,
their policies and procedures so that they are reasonably designed to prevent
violations of the Advisers Act and the rules thereunder in connection with (i)
the disclosure of conflicts of interest; and (ii) investment selection, including the
selection of cash sweep products and mutual fund share class selection.

Within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order, Respondents shall notify
affected investors (i.e., those former and current clients who were financially
harmed by the practices detailed above (hereinafter, “Affected Advisory
Clients”)) of the settlement terms of this Order by sending a copy of this Order
to each Affected Advisory Client via mail, email, or such other method not
unacceptable to the Commission staff, together with a cover letter in a form not
unacceptable to the Commission staff.

Within forty (40) days of the entry of this Order, Respondents shall certify, in
writing, compliance with the undertaking(s) set forth in paragraphs 41.a through
41.d above. The certification shall identify the undertaking(s), provide written
evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits
sufficient to demonstrate compliance. The Commission staff may make
reasonable requests for further evidence of compliance, and Respondents agree
to provide such evidence. The certification and supporting material shall be
submitted to Jeffrey Shank, Assistant Regional Director, Chicago Regional
Office, Securities and Exchange Commission, 175 West Jackson Boulevard,
Suite 1450, Chicago, IL 60604, or such other address as the Commission staff
may provide, with a copy to the Office of Chief Counsel of the Division of
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F. Street, NE,
Washington, DC 20549.

For good cause shown, the Commission staff may extend any of the procedural
dates relating to the undertakings set forth in paragraphs 41.a through 41.¢
above. Deadlines for procedural dates shall be counted in calendar days, except
that if the last day falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the next business day
shall be considered the last day.

the provisions of this Subsection C.

(iv) Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a Fair
Fund is created for the penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest paid by
Huntleigh and Datatex described above for distribution to affected investors (i.e.,
those former and current clients who were financially harmed by the practices
detailed above (hereinafter, “Affected Advisory Clients”)). Amounts ordered to be
paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid
to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the
deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor
Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset
or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of
Respondents’ payment of a civil penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset’). If the
court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents
agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty
Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall
not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the
amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this
paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a private damages action brought
against Respondents by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially

11

the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.

(v) Within ten (10) days of the entry of this Order, Huntleigh shall deposit
$843,502 and Datatex shall deposit $50,000 (the “Fair Fund”) into an escrow
account at a financial institution not unacceptable to the Commission staff and
Respondents shall provide evidence of such deposit in a form acceptable to the
Commission staff. The account holding the assets of the Fair Fund shall bear the
name and the taxpayer identification number of the Fair Fund. If timely payment
into the escrow account is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC
Rule of Practice 600 [17 C.F.R. § 201.600] and/or 31 U.S.C. § 3717.

(vi) | Huntleigh shall be responsible for administering the Fair Fund and may
hire a professional at its own cost to assist it in the administration of the
distribution. The costs and expenses of administering the Fair Fund, including any
such professional services, shall be borne by Huntleigh and shall not be paid out of
the Fair Fund.

(vii) | Huntleigh shall distribute from the Fair Fund an amount based on the
financial harm to the Affected Advisory Clients during the Relevant Period by the
practices discussed above, pursuant to a disbursement calculation (the
“Calculation”) that will be submitted to, reviewed, and approved by the
Commission staff in accordance with this Subsection C. The Calculation shall be
subject to a de minimis threshold that is approved by the Commission staff. No
portion of the Fair Fund shall be paid to any Affected Advisory Client account in
which Respondents, or any of their current or former officers, directors, or [ARs
has a financial interest.

(viii) Huntleigh shall, within ninety (90) days of the entry of this Order,
submit the Calculation to the Commission staff for review and approval. At or
around the time of submission of the proposed Calculation to the staff, Huntleigh
shall make itself available, and shall require any third parties or professionals
retained by Respondents to assist in formulating the methodology for its
Calculation and/or administration of the distribution to be available for a conference
call with the Commission staff to explain the methodology used in preparing the
proposed Calculation and its implementation, and to provide the staff with an
opportunity to ask questions. Huntleigh also shall provide the Commission staff
such additional information and supporting documentation as the Commission staff
may request for the purpose of its review. In the event of one or more objections by
the Commission staff to Huntleigh’s proposed Calculation or any of its information
or supporting documentation, Huntleigh shall submit a revised Calculation for the
review and approval of the Commission staff or additional information or
supporting documentation within ten (10) days of the date that the Commission
staff notifies Huntleigh of the objection. The revised Calculation shall be subject to
all of the provisions of this Subsection C.

12

(ix)  Huntleigh shall, within thirty (30) days of the written approval of the
Calculation by the Commission staff, submit a payment file (the “Payment File”)
for review and acceptance by the Commission staff demonstrating the application
of the methodology to each Affected Advisory Client. The Payment File should
identify, at a minimum: (1) the name of each Affected Advisory Client; (2) the net
amount of the payment to be made, less any tax withholding; (3) the amount of any
de minimis threshold to be applied; and (4) the amount of reasonable interest paid,
if applicable. Huntleigh shall exclude from the payee file all payments to payees
that appear on the U.S. Treasury Department Specially Designated Nationals List.

(x) Huntleigh shall disburse all amounts payable to Affected Advisory
Clients within ninety (90) days of the date the Commission staff accepts the
Payment File unless such time period is extended as provided in paragraph (xiv) of
this Subsection C. Huntleigh shall notify the Commission staff of the date[s] and
the amounts paid in the distribution.

(xi) | If Huntleigh is unable to distribute or return any portion of the Fair Fund
for any reason, including an inability to locate an Affected Advisory Client or a
beneficial owner of an Affected Advisory Client’s account or any other factors
beyond Huntleigh’s control, Huntleigh shall transfer any such undistributed funds
to the Commission for transmittal to the United States Treasury subject to Section
21F(g)(3) of the Exchange Act once the distribution of funds is complete and before
the final accounting provided for in paragraph (xiii) of this Subsection C is
submitted to the Commission staff. Payment must be made in one of the following
ways:

(a) Huntleigh may transmit payment electronically to the
Commission, which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire
instructions upon request;

(b) Huntleigh may make direct payment from a bank account via
Pay.gov through the SEC website at
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(c) Huntleigh may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or
United States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

(xii) A Fair Fund is a Qualified Settlement Fund (“QSF”) under Section
468B(g) of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), 26 U.S.C. §§ 1.468B.1-1.468B.5.
Respondents agree to be responsible for all tax compliance responsibilities
associated with the Fair Fund’s status as a QSF. These responsibilities involve
reporting and paying requirements of the Fund, including but not limited to: (1) tax
returns for the Fair Fund; (2) information return reporting regarding payments to
Affected Advisory Clients, as required by applicable codes and regulations; and (3)
obligations resulting from compliance with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance
Act. Respondents may retain any professional services necessary. The costs and
expenses of tax compliance, including any such professional services, shall be
borne by Respondents and shall not be paid out of the Fair Fund.

(xiii) Within one hundred fifty (150) days after Huntleigh completes the
disbursement of all amounts payable to Affected Advisory Clients, Huntleigh shall
return all undisbursed funds to the Commission pursuant to the instruction set forth
in this Subsection C. Huntleigh shall then submit to the Commission staff a final
accounting and certification of the disposition of the Fair Fund for Commission
approval, which final accounting and certification shall include, but not be limited

requests by the Commission staff in connection with the accounting and
certification.

(xiv) The Commission staff may extend any of the procedural dates set forth
in this Subsection C for good cause shown. Deadlines for dates relating to the Fair
Fund shall be counted in calendar days, except if the last day falls on a weekend or
federal holiday, the next business day shall be considered the last day.

Dz Respondents shall comply with the undertakings enumerated in Section II,
paragraphs 41.a through 41.¢ above.

","The SEC found that investment advisers Huntleigh Advisors and Datatex Investment Services failed to fully disclose conflicts of interest related to compensation they and their affiliated broker-dealer received from client transaction fees, cash sweep accounts, 12b-1 fees, and margin interest. Huntleigh and Datatex also breached their fiduciary duty by failing to evaluate whether certain practices provided best execution for clients. In addition, the firms lacked adequate compliance policies and procedures concerning disclosure of conflicts and best execution. As a result, Huntleigh and Datatex were censured, ordered to cease and desist, and to pay over $893,000 in disgorgement, interest, and penalties. The firms agreed to undertake remedial measures including revising disclosures, evaluating share classes for clients, and enhancing compliance policies and procedures."

Lighthouse Capital Group, LLC (Respondent)
Member Firm
CRD No. 169135

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Lighthouse Capital Group, LLC submits this Letter
of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND
Lighthouse Capital Group, LLC has been a FINRA member since 2014 and is
headquartered in Pasadena, CA. It has approximately 25 registered representatives in one
branch. Lighthouse engages primarily in solicitation and sale of private placement
securities. !
OVERVIEW
From January 2017 to December 2018, Lighthouse did not establish, maintain, and
enforce a supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, reasonably
designed to ensure that it did not engage in general solicitations of private placements.
Accordingly, Lighthouse violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.
FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This matter originated from a review by FINRA’s Corporate Finance Department.

FINRA Rule 3110(a) requires a member firm to establish and maintain a system to
supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve

' For more information about the firm, visit BrokerCheck® at www finra.org/brokercheck.

compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA
rules. FINRA Rule 3110(b) requires a member firm to establish, maintain, and enforce
written procedures to supervise the types of business in which it engages and the
activities of its associated persons that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA Rules. A
violation of FINRA Rule 3110 also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010, which requires
members to “observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable
principles of trade” in the conduct of their business.

Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 prohibits the offer or sale of securities unless
either a registration statement is in effect as to such securities or the sales are exempt
from registration. Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act exempts from registration
“transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.” Rule 506(b) of
Regulation D provides a safe harbor under Section 4(a)(2) for private offerings of
unregistered securities if certain conditions are met. One such condition is that the
offering must not involve a general solicitation to market the securities. Rule 502(c) of
Regulation D, in turn, generally sets forth the forms of prohibited general solicitations.

The SEC has stated that a broker-dealer, acting on behalf of an issuer, can demonstrate
the absence of general solicitation under Rule 502(c) by establishing a pre-existing,
substantive relationship with the prospective investors. A “pre-existing relationship is one
... that was established through . . . a registered broker-dealer . . . prior to the registered
broker-dealer[’s] . . . participation in the offering.”? “A ‘substantive’ relationship is one
in which the issuer (or a person acting on its behalf) has sufficient information to
evaluate, and does, in fact, evaluate, a prospective offeree’s financial circumstances and
sophistication, in determining his or her status as an accredited or sophisticated
investor.” For example, a broker-dealer can establish a pre-existing, substantive
relationship with a prospective investor through a previous investment in securities
offered by the issuer or through the broker-dealer. It can also do so through submission
and approval of an investor qualification questionnaire that is unrelated to any specific
offering and elicits adequate information for the firm to determine the financial
circumstances and sophistication of the client.

In 2017 and 2018, Lighthouse sold approximately 65 private placements in reliance on
the Rule 506(b) safe harbor, raising approximately $273 million in capital for issuers.

During this period, Lighthouse’s supervisory system and written supervisory procedures
were not reasonably designed to prevent general solicitations of private placements. In
particular, Lighthouse’s supervisory system did not consistently monitor and document
when the firm established a substantive relationship with a prospective investor, or to
confirm—before a prospective investor was solicited for an offering—that the firm had a
substantive relationship with that investor. The firm failed to systematically collect

https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/securities-act-rules.

3 See id., Question 256.31.


complete information regarding prospective investors and failed to have a reasonable
system to determine the date the firm first developed a substantive relationship with each
prospective investor. Accordingly, the firm was not able to always confirm that it had a
pre-existing, substantive relationship with a prospective investor prior to soliciting the
prospective investor for an offering. As a result, with respect to certain of the actual or
prospective investors in at least eight of the offerings referenced above, the firm was
unable to reasonably supervise the solicitations to ensure that a pre-existing, substantive
relationship existed prior to the solicitation in compliance with applicable rule
requirements.

Further, during this period, the firm’s written supervisory procedures did not define what
constituted general solicitation or give sufficient guidance or instruction to the firm’s
supervisors about whether, when, or how to review the activities of firm personnel to
ensure that general solicitation was not occurring.

Subsequent to the relevant period herein, Lighthouse revised its supervisory systems and
written procedures in this area by, among other things, requiring the firm’s
representatives to consistently obtain and document each potential investor’s
accreditation, investment experience and goals, and other financial information within the
firm’s books and records prior to any solicitation being made.

Therefore, Respondent violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.
Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
7 a censure; and

. a $250,000 fine.

Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this

matter.

The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.

II.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:

A. To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against it;

B. To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations
in writing;

Cc To defend against the allegations in a disciplinary hearing before a hearing panel,
to have a written record of the hearing made, and to have a written decision
issued; and

D. To appeal any such decision to the National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) and
then to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court of
Appeals.

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such
person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.

Respondent further specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that a person violated
the ex parte prohibitions of FINRA Rule 9143 or the separation of functions prohibitions of
FINRA Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions
regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including
its acceptance or rejection.

I.
OTHER MATTERS
Respondent understands that:
A. Submission of this AWC is voluntary and will not resolve this matter unless and

until it has been reviewed and accepted by the NAC, a Review Subcommittee of
the NAC, or the Office of Disciplinary Affairs (ODA), pursuant to FINRA
Rule 9216;

B. If this AWC is not accepted, its submission will not be used as evidence to prove
any of the allegations against Respondent; and

C. If accepted:

1. this AWC will become part of Respondent’s permanent disciplinary
record and may be considered in any future action brought by FINRA or
any other regulator against Respondent;

2. this AWC will be made available through FINRA’s public disclosure
program in accordance with FINRA Rule 8313;

3. FINRA may make a public announcement concerning this agreement and
its subject matter in accordance with FINRA Rule 8313; and

4. Respondent may not take any action or make or permit to be made any
public statement, including in regulatory filings or otherwise, denying,
directly or indirectly, any finding in this AWC or create the impression
that the AWC is without factual basis. Respondent may not take any
position in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of FINRA, or to which
FINRA is a party, that is inconsistent with any part of this AWC. Nothing
in this provision affects Respondent’s right to take legal or factual
positions in litigation or other legal proceedings in which FINRA is not a
party. Nothing in this provision affects Respondent’s testimonial
obligations in any litigation or other legal proceedings.

D. Respondent may attach a corrective action statement to this AWC that is a
statement of demonstrable corrective steps taken to prevent future misconduct.
Respondent understands that it may not deny the charges or make any statement
that is inconsistent with the AWC in this statement. This statement does not
constitute factual or legal findings by FINRA, nor does it reflect the views of
FINRA.

The undersigned, on behalf of Respondent, certifies that a person duly authorized to act on
Respondent’s behalf has read and understands all of the provisions of this AWC and has been
given a full opportunity to ask questions about it; that Respondent has agreed to the AWC’s
provisions voluntarily; and that no offer, threat, inducement, or promise of any kind, other than
the terms set forth in this AWC and the prospect of avoiding the issuance of a complaint, has
been made to induce Respondent to submit this AWC.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:

Summary

1. From at least March 2017 through May 2019 (the “Relevant Period”), Respondent,
a dually registered investment adviser and broker-dealer, failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports
(“SARs”) with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(“FinCEN”) when it knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect that the transactions facilitated
fraudulent activity or had no legitimate business basis or apparent lawful purpose. During the
Relevant Period, Cambria ignored numerous red flags listed in its anti-money laundering (“AML”)
policies, which were contained within its Written Supervisory Procedures (““WSPs’’). Cambria also
failed to properly investigate certain suspicious conduct, failed to investigate certain red flags, and
ultimately failed to file SARs when required.

2. During the Relevant Period, Cambria was a broker-dealer that specialized in
helping its customers liquidate microcap! securities. Numerous transactions by Cambria customers
raised “red flags” that indicated customers may have been involved in suspicious activities. Most
of these suspicious activities were associated with the liquidation of microcap securities, including
the deposit of physical certificates, the liquidation of large quantities of these securities, and the
immediate wire out of funds from customer accounts. In addition, in many of these transactions,
the pattern of liquidations often occurred in combination with other red flags noted in Cambria’s
policies and procedures, such as unusually large deposits, suspicious wire activity, or multiple
accounts simultaneously trading in the same microcap security. Cambria failed to investigate its
customers’ suspicious trading and similarly failed to file SARs for many of the transactions even
though Cambria’s WSPs identified such activity as risk indicators (red flags) of suspicious activity,
and required further investigation for the possible filing of aSAR. During the Relevant Period,
notwithstanding Cambria’s business focus on the liquidation of microcap securities and the
existence of numerous red flags, Cambria has no record of investigating any suspicious activity
and filed only two SARs.

3h By failing to file SARs as required, Cambria willfully violated Section 17(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8 thereunder.

Respondent

4. Cambria Capital, LLC is organized in Utah as a limited liability company, with its
principal place of business in Salt Lake City, Utah. It has been registered with the Commission as
a broker-dealer since May 2005. Cambria was registered with the Commission as an investment

' The term microcap securities applies to companies with low or “micro” capitalizations, meaning the total value of
the company’s stock. See Microcap Stock: A Guide For Investors (Sept. 18, 2013),
https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsmicrocapstockhtm.html. The securities at issue
here are those microcap securities that trade for under five dollars per share. See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(51) and
Rule 3a51-1 thereunder.


adviser until December 31, 2019, when it withdrew from SEC registration after completing its
switch to state investment adviser registration, and it is currently a state-registered investment
adviser. Cambria settled a disciplinary matter with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(“FINRA”) in 2008 that involved, among other things, the failure to file SARs in connection with
questionable securities activities in customer accounts. (Case No. 2007007402901.) During the
Relevant Period, Cambria specialized in facilitating the sale of large volumes of often thinly-traded
microcap stocks and made between approximately 50 and 70 percent of its revenue from microcap
transactions. According to its most recently filed Form ADV, Cambria has 163 clients and $13.2
million in regulatory assets under management.

Background
A. The Bank Secrecy Act

5. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), and implementing regulations promulgated by
FinCEN, require that broker-dealers file SARs with FinCEN to report a transaction (or a pattern of
transactions of which the transaction is a part) conducted or attempted by, at, or through the
broker-dealer involving or aggregating to at least $5,000 that the broker dealer knows, suspects, or
has reason to suspect: (1) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is conducted to disguise
funds derived from illegal activities; (2) is designed to evade any requirement of the BSA; (3) has
no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would
normally be expected to engage, and the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation of the
transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of
the transaction; or (4) involves use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal activity. 31 C.F.R. §
1023.320(a)(2) (“SAR Rule”). Broker-dealers are required to file the SAR 30 calendar days after
the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR under the SAR
Rule. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(b)(3). In cases where the broker-dealer cannot identify a suspect, it
must file the SAR within 60 days of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for
filing a SAR. Jd.

6. Exchange Act Rule 17a-8 requires broker-dealers registered with the Commission
to comply with the reporting, recordkeeping, and record retention requirements of Chapter X of
title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulation. The failure to file a SAR as required by the SAR Rule
is a violation of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8 thereunder. See SEC v. Alpine
Sec. Corp., 308 F. Supp. 3d 775, 798-800 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), aff'd 982 F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 2020), cert.
denied, Alpine Sec. Corp. v. SEC, 142 §. Ct. 461 (2021).

B. Cambria’s AML Compliance Department and Program

‘Le During the Relevant Period, Cambria’s WSPs stated that Cambria will file SARs
“for transactions that may be indicative of money laundering activity.” The WSPs acknowledge
that, “[s]uspicious activities include a wide range of questionable activities” and provide numerous
examples, including “heavy trading in low-priced securities.” Cambria’s AML policies and
procedures specifically identify various “risk indicators (red flags) that may suggest potential

money laundering” and other fraudulent activities. These specific AML red flags, many of which
are also described as red flags in industry notices issued by FINRA,’ include the following:

The customer (or a person publicly associated with the customer) has a questionable
background or is the subject of news reports indicating possible criminal, civil, or
regulatory violations.

The customer engages in suspicious activity involving the practice of depositing penny
stocks, liquidates them, and wires proceeds. A request to liquidate shares may also
represent engaging in an unregistered distribution of penny stocks which may also be a red
flag.

Customer transactions include a pattern of receiving stock in physical form or the incoming
transfer of shares, selling the position and wiring out the proceeds.

Two or more accounts trade an illiquid stock suddenly and simultaneously.
The customer’s account has unexplained or sudden extensive wire activity.

The customer’s account indicates large or frequent wire transfers, immediately withdrawn
by check or debit card without any apparent business purpose.

Cambria’s WSPs specifically address additional red flags with transactions involving penny stocks,
including where the issuer:

has no business, no revenues and no product;
has experienced frequent or continuous changes in its business structure;
undergoes frequent material changes in business strategy or its line of business; and

has not made disclosures in SEC or other regulatory filings or has been the subject of a
prior trading suspension.

8. Cambria’s AML process involved vetting deposits by requiring customers to submit

a deposit packet that provided information on the origin of the shares, whether the shares were
registered or an exemption to registration existed, any additional shares owned or controlled by the
customer, and other information to establish the shares as freely tradeable. Once Cambria is made
aware of a red flag, Cambria’s WSPs require additional research to determine whether Cambria
should file a SAR.

Facts

A. Cambria Failed to Investigate Red Flags.

9. Throughout the Relevant Period, Cambria became aware of or should have become
aware of hundreds of red flags, as defined by its own WSPs. Yet Cambria only filed SARs in two
instances.

10. For example, Cambria customers routinely engaged in patterns of heavy trading,
unusual wires, unusually large volume deposits or trades, and the quick deposit and subsequent
liquidation of microcap securities and immediately wiring out the proceeds. Despite Cambria’s
WSPs identifying this conduct as being a “red flag” and possibly “suspicious,” Cambria did not
investigate, or where necessary, file SARs concerning its customers’ transactions that followed
those patterns.

11. Cambria also failed to investigate numerous red flags identified by Cambria’s
WSPs related to opening customer accounts, including illegible or expired proof of identification
from customers whom they did not meet, and who occasionally were from foreign countries that
are at higher risk for money laundering.’ Cambria also failed to investigate other red flags that
might indicate suspicious conduct, including that certain customers provided inconsistent
addresses, including addresses that corresponded to a dirt lot, a FedEx/UPS location, or a strip mall
that did not have office space.

12. Similarly, Cambria, without taking any steps to investigate or analyze the conduct
or the entity or person engaging in the conduct, routinely processed transactions for customers
selling securities in microcap issuers that (a) had little to no revenue, (b) changed their name or
business model several times, (c) had no physical office or business operations, and/or (d) had a
late or delinquent filing history with the Commission — all enumerated as red flags of suspicious
activities in Cambria’s WSPs.

13. Finally, Cambria failed to properly investigate red flags concerning unexplained or
sudden extensive wire activity as required by its WSPs, often failing to investigate red flags at all.
For example, money movement reports identified numerous instances of many small wires in a
short time period for no apparent business reason. Additionally, money movement reports showed
numerous instances of several early smaller wires, followed by larger and larger ones until the
account was closed. Similarly, Cambria failed to properly investigate what appeared to be
coordinated liquidations of the same microcap security across several customer accounts, as
required by the firm’s WSPs.

3 Several of these countries are listed on the U.S. Department of State’s website as jurisdictions at high risk of
money laundering, including Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Taiwan. See Major Money Laundering Countries
(state.gov), https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/inl/rls/nrerpt/2003/vol2/html/29929. htm.

B. Cambria Failed to File SARs.

14. Throughout the Relevant Period, Cambria failed to report certain suspicious activity
that Cambria knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect was indicative of illegal activity.
Accordingly, Cambria failed to file SARs when the firm was required to do so.

15. For instance, Cambria submitted a deposit for Customer | to its clearing broker on
May 1, 2018, of 36 million shares of a microcap issuer valued at less than $0.01 per share. This
deposit was 3,080% of the 30-day trading average for that issuer. Cambria’s clearing broker sent
Cambria an email highlighting numerous red flags and raising AML and other concerns about the
customer’s identity, how he came to own the shares, and the issuer. Cambria provided the clearing
broker with the customer’s responses to those concerns and the deposit was ultimately processed.
By June 6, 2018 — less than 30 days after the deposit was accepted — the customer liquidated the
shares and wired the sales proceeds totaling $75,000 out of the account. In June 2018, Cambria
accepted two additional deposits from Customer | of shares of the same microcap issuer. The
deposits were of 37 million and 32 million shares, which represented 931% and 438% of the 30-
day trading average, respectively. Within weeks of each deposit, the customer sold the shares and
wired the proceeds totaling $120,000 out of the account. Customer | attempted to deposit an
additional 585,000 shares of the same microcap issuer in August 2018. After initially approving
the deposit, Cambria’s clearing broker informed Cambria that it could not accept the deposit
because the issuer was delinquent in its 10-Q filing and was participating in promotional activity
concerning the security the customer was attempting to deposit, which Cambria acknowledged in
internal emails were red flags of suspicious activity. Cambria eventually rescinded approval for
the deposit. Given the red flags that ultimately led Cambria to reject Customer 1’s deposit in
August 2018, Cambria had reason to suspect illegal activity, and thus, was required to file a SAR,
but failed to do so.

16. Similarly, Cambria opened an account for Customer 2 in June 2017 even though
Cambria was aware of numerous red flags as identified in its WSPs as a result of routine searches
performed by an employee as part of the account opening process, including that a principal of
Customer 2 had been previously sued for fraud by an investor. Customer 2 deposited 500,000
shares of a microcap stock trading at less than $0.01 per share in June 2017. That deposit
represented 625,000% of the 30-day trading volume. Between December 2017 and February 2018,
Customer 2 made three additional deposits totaling 1.5 million shares. Each deposit was hundreds
of percent of the 30-day trading volume. Customer 2 began liquidating its position and within 30
days of each sale wired most of the proceeds out of the account. Moreover, the account included
extensive and unexplained wires that were small at first — three wires in November 2017 that were
less than $10,000 each, and gradually increased over time until they were six figures each.
Cambria’s WSPs note that large deposits, quick liquidation of microcap securities, and unusual
wire patterns are all red flags of suspicious activity. Despite having reason to suspect illegal
activity as a result of these red flags, which required Cambria to file a SAR, it did not do so.

17. In another example, Cambria failed to file a SAR related to numerous red flags it
encountered related to Customer 3. In February 2018, Cambria opened an account for Customer 3
that identified Customer 3’s business address as being in a strip mall with retail stores that had no
traditional office space. Customer 3’s principal provided Cambria with an expired driver’s license

6

and other questionable or illegible forms of identification. One such form of identification was a
partial bank statement that listed an address that corresponded with a dirt lot that had a mail box on
it. Shortly after opening its account, Customer 3 deposited 1 million shares of a microcap stock
trading at less than $0.01 per share. The deposit represented 4,116% of the 30-day trading average
of that stock. Customer 3 noted in account opening documents that it was engaged in the “regular
business” of “buying and selling stock for [its] own account.” Customer 3 liquidated its position
and wired out the sales proceeds of more than $13,000 over the next few months. There is no
evidence Cambria investigated the numerous red flags associated with Customer 3, such as the
unusually large deposit and quick liquidation of securities of a questionable issuer. Despite having
reason to suspect illegal activity as a result of these red flags, which required Cambria to file a
SAR, it did not do so.

18. By engaging in the conduct described above, Cambria willfully violated Section
17(a) of the Exchange act and Rule 17a-8 thereunder.

Undertakings

Respondent has undertaken to:

A. Within 30 days from the issuance of this Order, at its own cost, hire an independent
AML Compliance Consultant, not unacceptable to the Commission staff, to conduct a
comprehensive review of Respondent’s AML compliance program and the implementation and
effectiveness of Respondent’s AML policies and procedures. The Respondent shall require the
Compliance Consultant to submit to the Commission’s staff a written report (the “Report”) on the
90th day from the issuance of this Order describing the review it performed, the names of the

recommendations for changes in or improvements to Respondent’s AML program.

B. Respondent shall adopt all recommendations contained in the Report within one
hundred fifty (150) days of the issuance of this Order; provided, that within one hundred and twenty
(120) days after the date of the Order’s issuance, Respondent shall in writing advise the Compliance
Consultant and the Commission staff of any recommendation that Respondent considers to be
unduly burdensome, impractical, or inappropriate. With respect to any recommendation that
Respondent considers unduly burdensome, impractical, or inappropriate, Respondent need not adopt
that recommendation at that time but shall propose in writing an alternative policy, procedure, or
system designed to achieve the same objective or purpose.

GC As to any recommendation with respect to Respondent’s policies and procedures on
which Respondent and the Compliance Consultant do not agree, Respondent and the Compliance
Consultant shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement within one hundred and fifty (150)
days after the date the Order is issued. Within fifteen (15) days after the conclusion of the
discussion and evaluation by Respondent and the Compliance Consultant, Respondent shall require
that the Compliance Consultant inform Respondent and the Commission staff in writing of the
Compliance Consultant’s final determination concerning any recommendation that Respondent
considers to be unduly burdensome, impractical, or inappropriate. Respondent shall abide by the

determinations of the Compliance Consultant and, within thirty (30) days after final agreement
between Respondent and the Compliance Consultant or final determination of the Compliance
Consultant, whichever occurs first, Respondent shall adopt and implement all of the
recommendations that the Compliance Consultant deems appropriate.

Dz Within thirty (30) days of Respondent’s adoption of all of the recommendations in
the Report that the Compliance Consultant deems appropriate, as determined pursuant to the
procedures set forth herein, certify in writing to the Compliance Consultant and the Commission
staff that Respondent has adopted and implemented all of the Compliance Consultant’s
recommendations in the Report. Thereafter, beginning two hundred forty days (240) after the entry
of the Order, the Compliance Consultant shall conduct such review as it deems appropriate to verify
that Respondent has appropriately implemented the recommendations in the Report. Unless
otherwise directed by the Commission staff, all Reports, certifications, and other documents
required to be provided to the Commission staff shall be sent to Mary S. Brady, Assistant Regional
Director, Denver Regional Office, 1961 Stout Street, Ste. 1700, Denver, CO 80294.

E. Cooperate fully with the Compliance Consultant and provide the Compliance
Consultant with access to such files, books, records, and personnel as are reasonably requested by
the Compliance Consultant for review.

F. To ensure the independence of the Compliance Consultant for the remainder of the
engagement: (1) not have the authority to terminate the Compliance Consultant or substitute another
compliance consultant for the Compliance Consultant without the prior written approval of the
Commission staff; and (2) compensate the Compliance Consultant and persons engaged to assist the
Compliance Consultant for services rendered pursuant to this Order at their reasonable and
customary rates.

G. Require the Compliance Consultant to enter into an agreement that provides that for
the period of engagement and for a period of two years from completion of the engagement, not to
(i) retain the Compliance Consultant for any other professional services outside of the services
described in this Order; (11) enter into any other professional relationship with the Compliance
Consultant, including any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional
relationship; or (iii) enter, without prior written consent of the Commission staff, into any such
professional relationship with any of the Compliance Consultant’s present or former affiliates,
employers, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such. The agreement
will also provide that the Compliance Consultant will require that any firm with which he/she is
affiliated or of which he/she is a member, and any person engaged to assist the Compliance
Consultant in performance of his/her duties under this Order shall not, without prior written consent
of the Commission staff, enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other
professional relationship with Respondent, or any of its present or former affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such for the period of the engagement and
for a period of two years after the engagement.

H. Preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year last
used, the first two years in an easily accessible place, any record of its compliance with the
undertakings set forth herein.

I. Certify, in writing, compliance with its undertakings set forth above. The
certification shall identify the undertakings, provide written evidence of compliance in the form ofa
narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance. The Commission
staff may make reasonable requests for further evidence of compliance, and Respondent agrees to
provide such evidence. The certification and supporting materials shall be submitted to Mary S.
Brady, Assistant Regional Director, with a copy to the Office of Chief Counsel of the Enforcement
Division, no later than sixty (60) days from the date of the completion of the undertakings.

J For good cause shown, the Commission staff may extend any of the procedural dates
relating to the undertakings. Deadlines for procedural dates shall be counted in calendar days,
except that if the last day falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the next business day shall be
considered to be the last day.

K. The reports by the Compliance Consultant will likely include confidential financial,
proprietary, competitive business or commercial information. Public disclosure of the reports could
discourage cooperation, impede pending or potential government investigations or undermine the
objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the
contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except (1) pursuant to court
order, (2) as agreed to by the parties in writing, (3) to the extent that the Commission determines in
its sole discretion that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Commission’s discharge of its
duties and responsibilities, or (4) is otherwise required by law.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.

Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Exchange Act and Section 203(e)
of the Advisers Act, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Respondent cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any
future violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8 promulgated thereunder.

B. Respondent is censured.

ey Respondent shall pay a civil penalty of $100,000 to the Securities and Exchange
Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act
Section 21F(g)(3).
Payment shall be made in the following installments:

() $25,000 within the 14 days of the entry of this order;

9

(2) four quarterly payments of $18,750 to be paid on or before the first of each
quarter thereafter.

Payments shall be applied first to post order interest, which accrues pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3717.
Prior to making the final payment set forth herein, Respondent shall contact the staff of the
Commission for the amount due. If Respondent fails to make any payment by the date agreed
and/or in the amount agreed according to the schedule set forth above, all outstanding payments
under this Order, including post-order interest, minus any payments made, shall become due and
payable immediately at the discretion of the staff of the Commission without further application to
the Commission.

Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

() Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch

HQ Bidg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying Cambria as
a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of the cover
letter and check or money order must be sent to Jason J. Burt, Division of Enforcement, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 1961 Stout Street, Ste. 1700, Denver, CO 80294.

Dz. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty

10

imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based
on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.

E. Respondent shall comply with the undertakings enumerated in Section III above.

By the Commission.

Vanessa A. Countryman
Secretary
","The SEC found that from March 2017 to May 2019, broker-dealer Cambria Capital failed to file required Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) when it knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect transactions involved fraudulent activity or lacked business purpose. Cambria processed transactions involving numerous red flags per its AML policies, including patterns of liquidating microcap securities, suspicious wires, and coordinating trading across accounts, without investigating or filing SARs. As a result, Cambria was censured, ordered to cease-and-desist, and to pay a $100,000 penalty.

In the Matter of:

Susquehanna Securities, LLC
401 City Ave., Suite 220

Bala Cynwyd, PA 19004-1122

Subject

Pursuant to the provisions of Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc. (“C2” or the “Exchange”) Rule 13.3 —
Expedited Proceeding,” Susquehanna Securities, LLC (“Susquehanna” or the “Firm”) submits this
Letter of Consent for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the alleged rule violations described
below.

The Firm neither admits nor denies that violations of Exchange Rules have been committed, and
the stipulation of facts and findings described herein do not constitute such an admission.

BACKGROUND

1. During all relevant periods herein, Susquehanna was acting as a registered Broker-
Dealer and was an Exchange Trading Permit Holder registered to conduct business
on the Exchange as a Market-Maker. The Firm’s registrations remain in effect.

Ds This matter originated from a review conducted by FINRA’s Department of Market
Regulation of the Firm’s compliance with listed position limits.

VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

Applicable Rules

3. During all relevant periods herein, Cboe Rule 8.30 as incorporated by reference by
and through C2 Chapter 5 and C2 Rule 8.30 — Position Limits* were in full force
and effect.

' This matter also incorporates findings from FINRA Matter No. 20220757260 which was merged into this matter.
? Chapter 13 of C2’s Rulebook incorporates Chapter 13 of Cboe’s Rulebook by reference, including Rule 13.3.

3 Effective November 20, 2019, Chapter 5 of C2’s Rulebook incorporated by reference Chapter 8 of Cboe’s
Rulebook, including Rule 8.30. Effective May 19, 2021, the relevant provisions of Chapter 5 of C2’s Rulebook
were incorporated into Chapter 8 of C2’s Rulebook.

DocuSign Envelope ID: A013C4EE-0187-4EAC-9E55-92EF298FE870

4. During all relevant periods (as applicable), Cboe Rule 8.30 and C2 Rule 8.30
provided, in relevant part:

...no Trading Permit Holder shall make, for any account in which it has an
interest or for the account of any customer, an opening transaction on any
exchange if the Trading Permit Holder has reason to believe that as a result
of such transaction the Trading Permit Holder or its customer would, acting
alone or in concert with others, directly or indirectly, (a) control an
aggregate position in an option contract dealt in on the Exchange in excess
of 25,000 or 50,000 or 75,000 or 200,000 or 250,000 option contracts
(whether long or short) of the put type and the call type on the same side of
the market respecting the same underlying security, combining for purposes
of this position limit long positions in put options with short positions in
call options, and short positions in put options with long positions in call
options, or such other number of option contracts as may be fixed from time
to time by the Exchange as the position limit for one or more classes or
series of options, or (b) exceed the applicable position limit fixed from time
to time by another exchange for an option contract not dealt in on the
Exchange, when the Trading Permit Holder is not a member of the other
exchange on which the transaction was effected.

5. Further, during all relevant periods (as applicable), Interpretation and Policy .04(c)
to Cboe Rule 8.30 and C2 Rule 8.30 provided, in relevant part:

An equity option position that is not delta neutral shall be subject to position
limits in accordance with this Rule 8.30 (subject to the availability of other
position limit exemptions). Only the option contract equivalent of the net
delta of such position shall be subject to the appropriate position limit. The
“options contract equivalent of the net delta” is the net delta divided by the
number of shares that equate to one option contract on a delta basis. The
term “net delta” means, at any time, the number of shares and/or other units
of trade (either long or short) required to offset the risk that the value of an
equity option position will change with incremental changes in the price of
the security underlying the option position, as determined in accordance
with a permitted pricing model.

Position Limit Violations
6. Susquehanna has availed itself of the Delta Hedge Exemption since March 19,

2008. For a firm using the Delta Hedge Exemption, any options position that is not
delta hedged remains subject to position and exercise limits.*

4 The net delta is the number of shares required (either long or short) to offset the risk that the value of an equity
options position will change with incremental changes in the price of the security underlying the options position. A
firm that is not delta neutral must be hedged to the extent that the Options Contract Equivalent of the Net Delta
(“OCEND”) stays within the applicable position limit. The Firm calculated the OCEND by using the OCC Permitted
Pricing Model. Once calculated, the OCEND must still be below the applicable position limit.

2021, 76,261 contracts on January 26, 2021, and 178,608 contracts on January 27,
2021. The Firm identified the position limit overage and redressed it on January
28, 2021.

On August 3, 2022, the applicable position limit in “DEF” options was 250,000
options contracts on the same side of the market.

During the trading day on August 3, 2022, the Firm maintained a position that was
not delta neutral in “DEF” and exceeded the applicable position limit in “DEF”
options by 3,493 contracts. The Firm corrected the position limit overage the
following business day.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds! that:

Summary

These proceedings involve KBCM’s failure to comply with Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12
(the “Rule”) when participating as an underwriter in certain primary offerings of municipal
securities. Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12 generally requires underwriters, in primary offerings of $1
million or more, to obtain disclosure documents from issuers and to reasonably determine that the
issuer of the municipal securities or an obligated person has undertaken to provide certain
information pertaining to the offered securities on a continuing basis to the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”). This undertaking is commonly referred to as a “continuing
disclosure undertaking” or a “continuing disclosure agreement.” Continuing disclosures enable
investors in municipal securities in the secondary market to make informed investment decisions
and to protect themselves from misrepresentations or other fraudulent activities by brokers, dealers
and municipal securities dealers.

Rule 15c2-12 includes an exemption for limited offerings of municipal securities placed
with a small number of sophisticated investors with investment intent. Underwriters participating in
offerings of municipal securities issued in denominations of $100,000 or more that are sold to no
more than thirty-five persons are exempt from the Rule’s requirements if the underwriters have a
reasonable belief that each purchaser: (1) has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment; and (2) is not
purchasing the securities for more than one account or with a view to distributing the securities.

From September 2017 to December 2021, KBCM, while serving as sole underwriter for 47
limited offerings, sold securities to broker-dealers and certain investment advisers without a
reasonable belief that the broker-dealers and investment advisers were purchasing the securities
for investment as required under Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12(d)(1)(i). Moreover, KBCM lacked
policies and procedures reasonably designed to determine if purchasers satisfied the exemption’s
requirements. As a result, KBCM violated Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12, as well as MSRB Rule
G-27, which requires municipal underwriters to adopt, maintain and enforce written supervisory
procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with Rule 15c2-12. KBCM also violated
Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act for failing to comply with the MSRB rule.

Respondent

1. KBCM, incorporated in Ohio and headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is registered
with the Commission as a broker-dealer and municipal advisor.

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

Rule 15c2-12 under the Exchange Act

2. Broker-dealers that participate as underwriters in primary offerings of municipal
securities of $1 million or more must comply with Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12 unless the
offering is exempt pursuant to Section (d) of the Rule.”

3s Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12 is designed to prevent fraud in primary offerings of
municipal securities. The Rule enhances the accuracy and timeliness of disclosures made to
investors by establishing standards for the procurement and dissemination of disclosure
documents by underwriters.

4. Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12(b) requires underwriters in primary offerings of
municipal securities: (a) to obtain and review a copy of an official statement deemed final by the
issuer of the municipal securities, except for the omission of specified information; (b) in non-
competitively bid offerings, to make available, upon request, the most recent preliminary official
statement, if any; (c) to contract with the issuer to receive, within specified time periods,
sufficient copies of the issuer’s final official statement; and (d) to provide, for a specified period
of time, copies of the final official statement to any potential customer upon request.* Before
purchasing or selling municipal securities in connection with an offering, the Rule also requires
an underwriter to reasonably determine that an issuer of municipal securities or an obligated
person has undertaken in a written agreement or contract, for the benefit of holders of such
securities, to provide annual reports containing certain financial information and operating data
to the MSRB, as well as timely notice of certain specified events pertaining to the municipal
securities being offered. This undertaking is commonly referred to as a “continuing disclosure
undertaking” or a “continuing disclosure agreement.” Continuing disclosures enable investors in
municipal securities in the secondary market to make informed investment decisions and to protect
themselves from misrepresentations or other fraudulent activities by brokers, dealers and municipal
securities dealers.

Exemption from Rule 15c2-12 for Limited Offerings

5. The primary intent of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12 is to focus on those offerings of
municipal securities that involve the general public and are likely to be actively traded in the
secondary market.* When the Commission adopted the Rule in 1989, it included exemptions

217 C.F.R. §§ 240.15c2-12(a) [general application of Rule] and (d) [offerings exempt from general application of
Rule].

3 Municipal Securities Disclosure, Exchange Act Rel. No. 34-26985, 54 Fed. Reg. 28799, 28800-01 (Final Rule, Jul.
10, 1989) [Rule 15c2-12 promulgated, in part, under Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 780(c)].

417 CER. §§ 240.15c2-12(b)(1)-(4).
517 CER. § 240.15c2-12(b)(5).

6 54 Fed. Reg. 28799 at 28809.

designed to facilitate certain offerings where the Commission believed that, given the sophistication
of the investors and the alternative mechanisms developed by the industry to facilitate disclosure in
connection with such offerings, the specific requirements of the Rule were not necessary to prevent
fraud or to encourage the dissemination of disclosure into the secondary market. This included an
exemption for limited offerings.’ Specifically, Section (d)(1)(i) of the Rule exempts primary
offerings of municipal securities “in authorized denominations of $100,000 or more, if such
securities ... are sold to no more than thirty-five persons each of whom the Participating
Underwriter reasonably believes: (A) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment; and (B) is
not purchasing for more than one account or with a view to distributing the securities.”*

6. The Commission was concerned that any securities offered pursuant to a limited
offering exemption could immediately be resold to public investors without the benefit of the
Rule’s requirements, including the undertaking by issuers to provide investors with continuing
disclosure about their investments. For these reasons, the Commission required that the securities
be issued in relatively large denominations, $100,000 or more, and that the underwriter have a
reasonable belief that the securities are being acquired by the purchaser for investment. The Rule
also requires underwriters to determine if each investor is purchasing the securities for one account
in order to preserve the integrity of the limitation on sales to no more than thirty-five persons.
Moreover, the persons that purchase the securities must possess the necessary knowledge and
experience to evaluate the merits and risks of the investment. The Rule does not identify purchasers
presumed to meet these criteria. Instead, the Rule requires that underwriters make a subjective
determination that investors meet the purchaser qualifications.’

KBCM Failed to Comply with the Limited Offering Exemption

7. From September 2017 to December 2021, KBCM acted as sole underwriter for at
least 47 offerings of municipal securities where it sought to rely on the exemption provided in
Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12(d)(1)(i), but where the offerings did not actually satisfy the
exemption’s requirements. KBCM did not provide investors in these securities with copies of
any Preliminary Official Statement or Final Official Statement for the securities, or determine
that a continuing disclosure undertaking had been entered into by the issuer, or an obligated
person, as required by Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12(b).

8. In these 47 limited offerings, KBCM sold the municipal securities to broker-
dealers and/or investment advisers with separately managed accounts. When it sold the
municipal securities to these broker-dealers and investment advisers, KBCM did not have a
reasonable belief that the broker-dealers and investment advisers were purchasing the securities
for investment as required under Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12(d)(1)(i). KBCM did not inquire, or
otherwise determine, if the broker-dealers and investment advisers were purchasing the securities

754 Fed. Reg. 28799 at 28801, 28808.
817 CER. §§ 240.15¢-12(d)(1)(i)-(ii).

° 54 Fed. Reg. 28799 at 28809-10.

for more than one account or for distribution. It also failed to ascertain for whom the broker-
dealers and investment advisers were purchasing the securities. KBCM therefore was unable to
form a reasonable belief that the broker-dealers and investment advisers were purchasing the
securities for investors who possessed the necessary knowledge and experience to evaluate the
investments. As a result, these 47 limited offerings did not qualify for the exemption under
Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12(d)(1)(q).

9. KBCM realized $263,607.66 from the 47 limited offerings that did not qualify for
the exemption under Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12(d)(1)(i) and that resulted in its failure to
comply with the disclosure requirements in Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12(b).

KBCM Failed to Adopt Policies and Procedures Reasonably
Designed to Ensure Compliance with the Limited Offering Exemption

10. MSRB Rule G-27(c) requires broker-dealers to adopt, maintain and enforce
written supervisory procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the conduct of the municipal
securities activities of the broker-dealer and its associated persons is in compliance with the
Exchange Act and MSRB rules.

11. From at least September 2017 through December 2021, KBCM did not have any
specific policies or procedures reasonably designed to comply with Exchange Act Rule 15c2-
12(d)(1)Q@) and enabling it to form a reasonable belief that persons to whom it sold municipal
securities pursuant to the limited offering exemption: (a) had such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that they were capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
prospective investment; and (b) were not purchasing for more than one account or with a view to
distributing the securities.

Violations

12. As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent willfully'® violated
Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12 and MSRB Rule G-27.

13. As aresult of Respondent’s willful violation of MSRB Rule G-27, Respondent
willfully violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act.

Disgorgement

14. The disgorgement and prejudgment interest ordered in paragraph IV.C is consistent
with equitable principles, does not exceed Respondent’s net profits from its violations, and

10 “willfully,” for purposes of imposing relief under Sections 15(b) and 15B(c) of the Exchange Act “means no
more than that the person charged with the duty knows what he is doing.” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414
(D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949)).

returning the money to Respondent would be inconsistent with equitable principles. Therefore, in
these circumstances, distributing disgorged funds to the U.S. Treasury is the most equitable
alternative. The disgorgement and prejudgment interest ordered in paragraph IV.C shall be
transferred to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, subject to Section 21F(g)(3) of the Exchange
Act.

Remedial Efforts

15. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts
promptly undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff.

IV.

On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public
interest to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.

Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 15(b), 15B(c) and 21C of the Exchange Act, it is
hereby ORDERED that:

A. Respondent cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any
future violations of Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12, and
MSRB Rule G-27.

B. Respondent is censured.

C. Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay disgorgement of
$263,607.66 and prejudgment interest of $33,528.55 to the Securities and Exchange Commission
for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section
21F(g)(3). Iftimely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of
Practice 600.

D. — Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money
penalty in the amount of $100,000.00 to the Securities and Exchange Commission, of which a
total of $16,667.00 shall be transferred to the MSRB in accordance with Section 15B(c)(9)(A)
of the Exchange Act, and of which the remaining $83,333.00 shall be transferred to the
general fund of the United States Treasury in accordance with Exchange Act Section
21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C.
§ 3717.

E. Payments must be made in one of the following ways:
(1) Respondent may transmit payments electronically to the Commission,

which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon
request;

Q) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via
Pay.gov through the SEC website at
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

GB) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch

HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
KBCM as a Respondent in these proceedings and the file number of these proceedings; a copy
of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Assistant Regional Director
Kevin B. Currid, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 33 Arch
Street, 24th Floor, Boston, MA 02110.

F. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall
be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). Ifthe court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty
imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based
on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Aeon Capital Inc. submits this Letter of Acceptance,
Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the alleged rule
violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if accepted, FINRA
will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based on the same
factual findings described in this AWC.

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND

Aeon has been a FINRA member since February 2013. The firm is headquartered in New
York, New York, and employs six registered representatives. The firm’s business
includes investment banking. !

OVERVIEW

Between May 2020 and March 2021, and again between May and October 2021, Aeon
conducted a securities business while failing to maintain the minimum required net
capital. As a result, Aeon violated Section 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1, and FINRA Rules 4110 and 2010. During those same
periods, Aeon failed to timely file with the SEC and FINRA notices of its net capital
deficiencies, and filed with FINRA inaccurate Financial and Operational Combined
Uniform Single (FOCUS) reports. In addition, between May 2020 and March 2021, Aeon
failed to maintain books and records reflecting an accurate computation of its aggregate
indebtedness and net capital. As a result, Aeon violated Exchange Act § 17(a), Exchange
Act Rules 17a-3, 17a-5, and 17a-11, and FINRA Rules 4511 and 2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
This matter originated from a cycle examination of the firm.

1. Aeon conducted a securities business while failing to maintain the required
minimum net capital.

Exchange Act § 15(c) and Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1 require broker-dealers to maintain
certain minimum levels of net capital. FINRA Rule 4110(b)(1) requires member firms to
suspend all business operations during any period in which they are not in compliance
with applicable net-capital requirements as set forth in Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1.
Violations of Exchange Act § 15(c), Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1, and FINRA Rule 4110
also constitute violations of FINRA Rule 2010, which requires members, in the conduct
of their business, to “observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable
principles of trade.”

On May 21, 2020, Aeon received a $150,000 loan from the Small Business
Administration through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, which the
federal government initiated in 2020 to assist small businesses as a result of the COVID-
19 pandemic. Receipt of the EIDL loan increased the firm’s aggregate indebtedness and
therefore increased the firm’s required minimum net capital. The firm, however, failed to
include the value of the loan when calculating its aggregate indebtedness, which caused
the firm to inaccurately calculate its required net capital. As a result, Aeon’s net capital
fell below the required minimum on May 21, 2020, and remained below it through March
30, 2021, when the firm added capital. Aeon conducted a securities business on 160 days
during that period.

Separately, in April 2021, Aeon began selling stock warrants of a biotechnology
company it had received as compensation for its participation in a private placement. On
May 10, 2021, Aeon effected its eleventh sale of the warrants, which constituted the
firm’s eleventh transaction for its own investment account during calendar year 2021 and
which increased the firm’s required net capital pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 15c3-
1(a)(2)(iii)(B).” Aeon, however, did not have the required minimum net capital until
October 25, 2021, when the firm added capital. Aeon conducted a securities business on
54 days between May 10 and October 25, 2021.

Based on the foregoing, Aeon violated Exchange Act § 15(c), Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1,
and FINRA Rules 4110 and 2010.

2. Aeon failed to file required notices of its net capital deficiencies.

Exchange Act § 17(a) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-11(a) require broker-dealers whose net
capital declines below the minimum amount to give “notice of such deficiency that same

? Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1(a)(2)(iii)(B) requires a broker-dealer to maintain net capital of not less than $100,000
when it “effects more than ten transactions in any one calendar year for its own investment account.”

day” to FINRA and the SEC. Violations of Exchange Act § 17(a) and Exchange Act
Rules 17a-11 constitute violations of FINRA Rule 2010.

Aeon failed to timely file the required notices for both of the net capital deficiency
periods discussed above: (1) May 21, 2020-March 30, 2021; and (11) May 10-October 25,
2021. Aeon did not file net capital deficiency notices with FINRA or the SEC until April
5, 2021 (for the first deficiency period) and October 25, 2021 (for the second deficiency
period).

Based on the foregoing, Respondent violated Exchange Act § 17(a), Exchange Act Rule
17a-11, and FINRA Rule 2010.

3. Aeon failed to make and preserve accurate records of aggregate indebtedness
and net capital and filed inaccurate FOCUS Reports.

FINRA Rule 4511 requires each FINRA member to make and preserve books and
records in conformity with the Exchange Act and the applicable Exchange Act rules.
Exchange Act § 17(a) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-3(a)(11) require broker-dealers to
prepare aggregate indebtedness and net capital calculations “at least once a month.”
Exchange Act § 17(a) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-5 require member firms to timely file
Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single (FOCUS) reports. Inherent in the
obligation to make and preserve books and record is the requirement that they be
accurate. Violations of Exchange Act § 17(a), Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5, and
FINRA Rule 4511 also constitute violations of FINRA Rule 2010.

Between May 2020 and March 2021, Aeon failed to include the value of the EIDL loan
as a liability and when calculating its aggregate indebtedness. This caused the firm to
prepare and maintain inaccurate aggregate indebtedness and net capital computations.
During that period, the firm filed 11 FOCUS reports that inaccurately stated the firm’s
aggregate indebtedness, minimum required net capital, net capital, and excess net capital.

Separately, between May 2021 and October 2021, Aeon failed to account for the firm’s

required net capital increase, which was triggered on May 10, 2021. During that period,

Aeon filed five FOCUS reports that inaccurately stated its minimum required net capital
and excess net capital.

Based on the foregoing, Respondent violated Exchange Act § 17(a), Exchange Act Rules
17a-3 and 17a-5, and FINRA Rules 4511 and 2010.

Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:

- a censure and

Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this
matter.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Webull Financial LLC submits this Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND

Webull Financial LLC became a FINRA member in January 2018 and began offering
trading to customers in May 2018.The firm offers low cost, self-directed trading to retail
investors through its mobile application and website. Headquartered in New York, New
York, the firm has three branch offices and approximately 75 registered representatives. !

OVERVIEW

From December 2019 (when the firm first offered options trading) through July 2021, the
firm did not exercise reasonable due diligence before approving customers to trade
options. During this period, the firm employed an automated, electronic system to
approve or disapprove customer accounts for options trading. Flaws in that system—and
the firm’s supervision of the system—resulted in customers being approved for options
trading authority who did not satisfy the firm’s eligibility criteria or whose accounts
contained red flags that options trading was potentially inappropriate for them. As a
result, the firm violated FINRA Rules 3110, 2360, and 2010.

From May 2018 through December 2021, the firm’s supervisory system, including
written supervisory procedures (WSPs), was not reasonably designed to identify and
respond to customer complaints. As a result, the firm violated FINRA Rules 3110(a),

3110(b)(5), and 2010. Also during this period, the firm did not report certain written
customer complaints to FINRA, as required, in violation of FINRA Rules 4530 and 2010.

Finally, from December 2019 through March 2021, the firm did not maintain and keep
current an options complaint log in violation of FINRA Rules 2360(b)(17) and 2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

A. The firm approved customers for options trading without exercising sufficient
due diligence.

FINRA Rule 2360(b)(16) requires that, in approving accounts for options trading, firms
exercise due diligence to ascertain “the essential facts relative to the customer,” including
the customer’s age, income, net worth, investment objectives, and investment experience
and knowledge. The Rule further requires that, “[b]ased upon such information,” a
principal at the firm—either a Registered Options Principal or a General Securities Sales
Supervisor—‘“specifically approve or disapprove in writing the customer’s account for
options trading.” Moreover, in determining whether and to what extent to approve an
account for options trading, a firm shall consider the information provided by the
customer “together with the other information available” to the firm.

FINRA Rule 3110(a) requires a member firm to “establish and maintain a system to
supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA
rules.” FINRA Rule 3110(b) requires a member firm to “establish, maintain, and enforce
written procedures to supervise the types of business in which it engages and the
activities of its associated persons that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA Rules.”

A violation of FINRA Rule 3110 or Rule 2360 also constitutes a violation of FINRA
Rule 2010, which requires firms to observe high standards of commercial honor and just
and equitable principles of trade in the conduct of their business.

From December 2019, when the firm first began offering options trading, through July
2021, the firm’s supervisory system was not reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with FINRA Rule 2360(b)(16).

1. The firm’s system for approving customers for options trading did not
consider information available to the firm.

The firm’s WSPs required that, “prior to opening an options account,” a designated
registered options principal must determine whether a customer shall be approved for
trading in options based on “information in the [customer’s] new account form and
option suitability questionnaire” (i.e. the firm’s options application) completed by the
customer at the time he or she applied for options trading authority. However, the
automated system that the firm used to approve customers for options trading authority
considered only information that a customer provided in his or her most recent options

2

suitability questionnaire—and did not compare such information to information
previously provided to the firm.

For example, during the relevant period, the firm required that customers seeking
approval to trade options spreads (a privilege granted only to customers approved for
“level 3” options trading authority) have at least three years of options trading
experience.” Because customers must be at least 18 years old to open brokerage accounts,
any customer under the age of 21 who applied for level 3 privileges could not have
attained the three years of options trading experience. Nonetheless, from mid-2020, when
the firm first began approving customers for level 3 options trading authority, through
July 2021, the firm’s automated system approved customers for level 3 options trading
authority based on the customers’ representations that they had three years of options
trading experience—even if the customers were younger than 21 years old.

The firm’s automated system also did not review customers’ previous applications to
search for and incorporate into its analysis any materially different information, or
applications that had previously been denied by the firm. As a result, the firm’s
automated system approved customers for options trading authority even when those
approval decisions were based on information that was inconsistent with information that
customers had previously submitted.

2. The firm did not reasonably review its automated system for approving
customers to trade options.

The firm conducted two types of reviews of its system for approving customer accounts
to trade options. First, the firm’s WSPs required that a registered options principal
manually perform a “reasonable amount of quality checks” each month. However,
registered options principals at the firm reviewed fewer than 100 accounts in each month
between December 2019 and July 2021—even in months where the firm approved tens or
hundreds of thousands of accounts to trade options.

Second, beginning in May 2021, the firm implemented an “Options Approval Check
Tool,” to conduct periodic reviews of accounts that the firm had previously approved for
options trading authority. During the relevant period the firm used the Options Approval
Check Tool simply to verify that its automatic approval system was functioning as
intended.

As a result, during the relevant period, the firm did not implement a system that was
reasonably designed to consider information previously submitted by the customers (such
as in prior applications) in reviewing customer applications for options trading authority.

2 Level 3 options trading provided customers, who were approved by the firm, with the ability to trade options
spreads. Levels 1 and 2 options trading provided customers approved by the firm with the ability to trade less
complex options, including covered calls, cash-secured puts, long calls, and long puts.

3

3. The firm approved customers for options trading who did not satisfy the
firm’s eligibility criteria or whose accounts contained red flags that
options trading was not appropriate for them.

During the relevant period, the firm approved for options trading authority certain
accounts that did not meet the firm’s eligibility criteria or that contained red flags that
options trading authority, or a specified level of options trading authority, was not
appropriate. Of such customers, only a small number actually traded options at levels for
which they were not eligible under the firm’s eligibility criteria.

First, between December 2019 and November 2020, the firm did not detect that its
automated system was programmed incorrectly. During that period, errors in the
programming of the automated system resulted in approvals for more than 9,000 accounts
for level | options trading authority who did not satisfy the firm’s eligibility criteria for
level 1 options. In particular, the firm approved accounts for level 1 options trading
authority that stated that they did not have any investment experience—an
acknowledgement that should have made the customers ineligible to trade options under
the firm’s eligibility criteria.

Second, throughout the relevant period, the firm’s automated system approved customers
for options trading authority who did not satisfy the firm’s eligibility criteria—and who,
according to the firm’s WSPs, were therefore not appropriately approved for options
trading. In particular, between mid-2020 through July 2021, the firm approved more than
2,500 customers under the age of 21 for level 3 options trading authority, even though the
firm’s eligibility criteria required that level 3 options customers have at least three years’
options trading experience. For example:

e One customer applied for approval for level 3 options trading authority on his
18th birthday. Consistent with the firm’s eligibility criteria, the firm rejected the
customer’s application because he stated at that time that he had between 1-2
years of options trading experience. Only two days later, the firm approved the
customer for level 3 options trading authority after he submitted a new application
stating that he had more than 5 years of options trading experience.

e Another customer was 19 years old when he applied for level 3 options trading
authority four times between June 4 and June 9, 2021. Consistent with the firm’s
eligibility criteria, the firm rejected all four applications because the customer
stated that he had 1-2 years of options trading experience. On June 10, 2021, the
customer again applied for a level 3 options trading authority, and once again
reported having 1-2 years of options trading experience. The firm again rejected
the customer’s application. But immediately after that fifth rejection, the customer
reapplied to trade options, stating that the customer had more than 5 years of
options trading experience. This time, the firm approved his application based on
that representation.

The firm approved other customers for options trading authority based on information
that was materially inconsistent with what those customers had previously told the firm.
For example:

e One customer applied twice, and was rejected twice, for level 3 options trading
authority on April 23, 2021, after reporting that he had no options trading
experience. The next day, the same customer applied, and was again rejected, to
trade level 3 options, after reporting that he had between 1-2 years’ options
trading experience. Two days later, on April 26, 2021, the firm approved the
customer for level 3 options trading authority after the customer reported that he
had more than 5 years’ options trading experience without verifying that the
customer in fact had such experience.

As aresult of the foregoing, the firm violated FINRA Rules 3110, 2360, and 2010.

Beginning in August 2021, the firm made numerous enhancements to its system for
approving customers for options trading including, among others, limiting how often
customers can submit applications for options trading authority in a given time period,
restricting customers from substantially increasing their claimed investment experience in
a given time period, and enhancing due diligence and verifications processes for
customers under the age of 25.

B. The firm did not establish and maintain a supervisory system, including WSPs,
reasonably designed to identify and respond to customer complaints.

FINRA Rule 3110(a) requires each member firm to establish and maintain a system to
supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA
tules. FINRA Rule 3110(b)(5) requires member firms to establish, maintain, and enforce
reasonably designed written supervisory procedures “to capture, acknowledge, and
respond to all written (including electronic) customer complaints.”*

From May 2018 through December 2021, the firm’s system for identifying and
responding to written customer complaints was not reasonably designed to identify and
respond to the volume of customer complaints it received. The firm relied on a lexicon as
one of its tools to identify potential customer complaints within written communications
received from customers. The lexicon was not sufficiently broad in scope to identify
certain customer complaints. For example, in December 2020, the firm received more
than 88,000 written customer communications, but only 15 were escalated for review as
potential customer complaints using the lexicon.* The firm’s WSPs were not reasonably
designed to identify customer complaints and stated throughout the relevant period that a
“customer complaint” includes “any written grievance by a customer or prospective

3 Regulatory Notice 14-10 reminds member firms that a failure to address a customer complaint (written or oral)
may constitute a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

4 The firm made some improvements to its supervisory system for identifying and responding to customer
complaints during the relevant period. In March 2021, it expanded the number of words and phrases in its lexicon.

5

customer” but “does not include routine information questions, operations concerns, or
service issues that can be readily resolved in a reasonable manner.” The WSPs failed to
clarify that where a customer’s question, operational concern, or service issue involved a
grievance, it should be considered a customer complaint.

During the relevant period, the firm experienced significant and rapid customer growth
but did not commit the staff and other resources necessary to keep pace with the
increasing number of customer communications it received. For example, between
January 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020, the firm received approximately 430,000
written customer communications, including complaints that required, but did not always
receive, a response.” As another example, in 2020, the firm received approximately
115,000 customer calls, which included customer complaints. Customers complained in
writing to the firm that they had tried calling the firm, but their issue was not addressed
during the call or they could not reach a customer service representative. °

Because the firm did not reasonably supervise its customer complaints system, it violated
FINRA Rules 3110(a), 3110(b)(5), and 2010.

C. The firm did not report certain customer complaints.

FINRA Rule 4530 requires member firms to report to FINRA certain customer
complaints. Rule 4530(a)(1)(B) requires each member to promptly report to FINRA, but
in any event not later than 30 calendar days, after the member knows or should have
known that “the member or an associated person of the member: . . . is the subject of any
written customer complaint involving allegations of theft or misappropriation of funds or
securities or of forgery.” FINRA Rule 4530(d) requires member firms to report to FINRA
statistical and summary information regarding written customer complaints in such detail
as FINRA shall specify by the 15th day of the month following the calendar quarter in
which customer complaints are received by the member. To comply with Rule 4530(d),
members must report any written grievance by a customer if the grievance concerns the
member or an associated person of the member.’ FINRA uses the information received
pursuant to Rule 4530 for regulatory purposes to identify and initiate investigations of
member firms, associated persons, and others that may pose a risk to investors.

A violation of FINRA Rule 4530 also constitutes a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.
From May 2018 to December 2021, the firm reported no complaints under FINRA Rule

4530(a)(1)(B) despite the fact that it received numerous written complaints alleging
misappropriation or theft.

5 For example, on August 17, 2020, a customer wrote to the firm that he could not withdraw money from his
account. Over the course of 25 days, the firm informed the customer that the issue had been fixed six times, only for
the customer to respond each time that he still could not withdraw funds. Then, the firm closed the customer’s
service ticket while his complaint remained unresolved.

6 In 2020, approximately 46 percent of calls to the firm were abandoned by customers and another 12 percent were
dropped. In some cases, the wait time for completed calls was over five hours.

7 FINRA Rule 4530 Supplementary Material .08.

The firm also underreported complaints under FINRA Rule 4530(d). From May 2018 to
December 2021, the firm’s WSPs did not provide reasonable guidance to its staff on how
to identify and report to FINRA customer complaints under Rule 4530(d) because,
among other things, the WSPs stated that “[a] complaint does not include routine . . .
operations concerns[] or service issues that can be readily resolved in a reasonable
manner” without clarifying that any such communication that also included a grievance
concerning the firm or a person associated with the firm should also be considered a
complaint. This caused the firm to fail to report an undetermined number of customer
complaints under FINRA Rule 4530(d). From May 2018 through December 2019, the
firm reported a total of eight customer complaints. In 2020, the firm reported a total of
only 69 written customer complaints despite receiving over 500,000 written customer
communications that year.

Therefore, the firm violated FINRA Rules 4530 and 2010.
D. The firm did not maintain and keep current an options complaint log.

FINRA Rule 2360(b)(17) requires each member firm to maintain and keep current a
separate central log, index, or other file for all options-related complaints, through which
the complaints can easily be identified and retrieved. An “options-related complaint” is
“any written statement by a customer or person acting on behalf of a customer alleging a
grievance arising out of or in connection with options.”

Although the firm started offering options trading in December 2019, it did not maintain
a separate options complaint log until January 2021, at which time it created a monthly
folder of options-specific complaints.* However, those monthly folders were incomplete
as to certain complaints. For example, the firm reported a March 2021 options-related
complaint to FINRA under Rule 4530(d), but did not include the complaint in its monthly
options complaint folder.

Therefore, during the period from December 2019 through March 2021, the firm violated
FINRA Rules 2360(b)(17) and 2010.

Member Firm
CRD No. 137862

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent SageTrader, LLC submits this Letter of Acceptance,
Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the alleged rule
violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if accepted, FINRA
will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based on the same
factual findings described in this AWC.

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND

SageTrader has been a FINRA member since May 2006. The firm is headquartered in
Englewood, New Jersey, maintains one branch office, and employs six registered
representatives. SageTrader provides order routing and execution services in equities to
institutional and U.S. registered broker-dealer clients.!

OVERVIEW

From July 2017 through November 2017, SageTrader mismarked approximately 9.7
million principal short sell orders, that resulted in approximately 390,000 executions, as
long in violation of Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO of the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 and FINRA Rule 2010.

In addition, from July 2017 through February 2018, SageTrader failed to locate shares
available for borrowing for approximately 490,000 principal short sales in violation of
Rule 203(b)(1) of Regulation SHO and FINRA Rule 2010.

Further, from July 2017 through August 2022, SageTrader failed to establish, maintain,
and enforce a supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, reasonably

designed to achieve compliance with Regulation SHO’s order marking and locate
requirements in violation of FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This matter originated from FINRA’s cycle examination of the firm.
SageTrader mismarked short-sale orders as long.

Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO requires that a broker-dealer mark all sell orders of any
equity security as “long,” “short” or “short exempt.” A sell order may only be marked
“long” if the seller is “deemed to own” the security being sold and either (i) the security
to be delivered is in the physical possession or control of the broker or dealer or (1i) it is
reasonably expected that the security will be in the physical possession or control of the
broker or dealer no later than the settlement of the transaction.

A violation of Rule 200(g) also constitutes a violation of FINRA Rule 2010, which states
that “[a] member, in the conduct of its business, shall observe high standards of
commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.”

In July 2017, SageTrader began effecting customer short sale orders on a net basis. Net
trading generally refers to contemporaneous principal transactions where the initial and
offsetting transactions are at different prices. For example, a firm trades on a “net” basis
when it accumulates a position at one price and executes the offsetting trade with its
customer or broker-dealer client at another price. SageTrader mismarked its principal
short sales as long in connection with its handling of net trades because it incorrectly
believed that the receipt of its customer sell order created an unconditional contract for
the firm to purchase the securities from the customer and the firm was, therefore, deemed
to own the securities.” SageTrader, however, had not entered into an unconditional
contract with its customer because SageTrader would only purchase the subject securities
from that customer if it was able to sell those securities to another broker-dealer. On
December 1, 2017, the firm began marking its principal sales as short.

From July 2017 through November 2017, SageTrader improperly marked approximately
9.7 million principal short sale orders as long. Those orders resulted in approximately
390,000 executions.

Therefore, SageTrader violated Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO and FINRA Rule 2010.
SageTrader failed to obtain locates for its short sales.

Rule 203(b)(1) of Regulation SHO provides that broker-dealers may not accept a short

sale order in an equity security from another person, or effect a short sale in an equity
security for its own account, unless it has (i) borrowed the security or entered into a bona

? Rule 200(b)(2) provides that a person shall be deemed to own a security if “[t]he person has purchased, or has
entered into an unconditional contract, binding on both parties thereto, to purchase it, but has not yet received it.”

2

fide arrangement to borrow the security, or (11) has reasonable grounds to believe the
security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due, and (iii)
has documented compliance with subsection (b)(1). A broker-dealer must, therefore,
locate securities available for delivery before effecting short sales for its own account. A
violation of Rule 203(b)(1) also constitutes a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

As a result of mismarking its principal sell orders as long from July 2017 through
November 2017, SageTrader effected approximately 390,000 short sales without
obtaining a locate. When the firm started marking its principal sales as short in December
2017, it also began uploading easy to borrow lists (ETBLs)’ to its smart order router
(SOR) to comply with Regulation SHO’s locate requirement. SageTrader, however,
failed to program the SOR to prevent the routing of short sale orders for securities that
were not on the ETBLs. From December 2017 through February 2018 the firm failed to
obtain locates for approximately 100,000 principal short sales. In late February 2018,
SageTrader discovered this programming error and imposed a block on its SOR for non-
ETBL securities.

By failing to obtain required locates for approximately 490,000 short sales, SageTrader
violated Rule 203(b)(1) of Regulation SHO and FINRA Rule 2010.

SageTrader failed to establish, maintain, and enforce a supervisory system
reasonably designed to comply with Rules 200(g) and 203(b)(1) of Regulation SHO
relating to order marking and locate requirements.

FINRA Rule 3110(a) requires a member firm to establish and maintain a system to
supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA
rules. FINRA Rule 3110(b) requires a member firm to establish, maintain, and enforce
written procedures to supervise the types of business in which it engages and the
activities of its associated persons that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules. A
violation of FINRA Rule 3110 also is a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

From July 2017 through August 2022, the firm failed to establish, maintain, and enforce a
supervisory system, including WSPs, reasonably designed to achieve compliance with
Regulation SHO’s order marking and locate requirements.

From July 2017 to December 2018, SageTrader did not conduct any supervisory reviews
and had no WSPs addressing order marking or locates for principal short sales.

In December 2018, the firm amended its WSPs to require periodic “spot checks” of
principal orders and executions to ensure that the firm’s SOR was properly marking

5 ETBLs are lists of securities that are readily available for borrowing and that generally may be used to satisfy Rule
203(b)(1)’s locate requirement. See SEC Division of Market Regulation: Responses to Frequently Asked Questions
Concerning Regulation SHO, FAQ 4.2.

principal sales as short and that securities sold short were on the ETBL. The amended
WSPs, however, failed to provide reasonable guidance as to when and how to conduct the
referenced spot checks and were not reasonably designed to achieve compliance with
Regulation SHO’s order marking and locate requirements.

Therefore, SageTrader violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.

B. Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
. a censure; and
. a $175,000 fine.
Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now

or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this
matter.

The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
II.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:

A. To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against it;

B. To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations
in writing;

C. To defend against the allegations in a disciplinary hearing before a hearing panel,
to have a written record of the hearing made, and to have a written decision
issued; and

Dz. To appeal any such decision to the National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) and
then to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court of
Appeals.

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such

person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.

Respondent further specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that a person violated
the ex parte prohibitions of FINRA Rule 9143 or the separation of functions prohibitions of
FINRA Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions
regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including
its acceptance or rejection.

Member Firm
CRD No. 8217

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Transamerica Capital, Inc. submits this Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND

Transamerica Capital, Inc. (TCI) has been a registered broker-dealer since 1980 and is
located in Denver, Colorado. The firm has approximately 400 registered representatives
and 27 branches. TCI is the principal underwriter and distributor of variable life
insurance and variable annuity products issued by its affiliates, Transamerica Life
Insurance Company and Transamerica Financial Insurance Company (Transamerica
variable products). TCI enters into selling agreements with other broker-dealers, who, in
turn, sell Transamerica variable products to their customers. These broker-dealers and the
owners of Transamerica variable products can contact call centers relating to
Transamerica variable products and other Transamerica insurance products
(Transamerica call centers).

OVERVIEW

From December 2019 to February 2021, TCI failed to register, or timely register, a
cumulative total of more than 400 call center workers employed by a third-party vendor
(call center personnel) who engaged in securities business on TCI’s behalf in capacities
that required registration. Therefore, the firm violated FINRA Rules 1210 and 2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This matter originated from a September 24, 2020 Form US filing disclosing the
termination of an associated but unregistered person of TCI who worked at a
Transamerica call center.

FINRA Rule 1210 provides that “[e]ach person engaged in the . . . securities business of a
member shall be registered with FINRA as a representative or principal in each category
of registration appropriate to his or her functions and responsibilities as specified in

Rule 1220, unless exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 1230.”

FINRA Rule 1230 Supplementary Material .01 states that “[t]he function of accepting
customer orders is not considered a clerical or ministerial function,” and “[e]ach person
associated with a member who accepts customer orders under any circumstances shall be
registered in an appropriate registration category pursuant to Rule 1220.” Regulatory
Notice 17-30 likewise makes clear that “[b]eginning on October 1, 2018, unregistered
persons cannot accept an order from a customer under any circumstances.”!

FINRA Rule 2010 states that “[a] member, in the conduct of its business, shall observe
high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.” A
violation of FINRA Rule 1210 also constitutes a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

During the period December 2019 to February 2021, a cumulative total of more than 400
call center personnel were not registered, or timely registered, despite their engaging in
conduct requiring registration. During this time, TCI used a contracted, third-party
vendor to administer the Transamerica call centers to handle calls and requests from
Transamerica variable product policy holders who had transaction requests related to
securities. These securities transaction requests included customer orders for investment
of additional premiums, reallocations of contract value among subaccounts, and
withdrawals of contract value.

These call center personnel handling transaction requests related to securities were
associated persons of TCI, and thus required to be registered in the category of
registration appropriate to his or her functions. Although TCI determined to register
certain of the call center personnel prior to the relevant period herein, and had advised
FINRA of that fact, the firm failed to register, or timely register, these individuals before
they engaged in the conduct requiring registration described above. By February 2021,
the firm had made changes to the Transamerica call centers with regard to the handling of
policy holder requests relating to Transamerica variable products, had approximately 175
individuals registered with TCI who handled policy holder requests relating to
Transamerica variable products, and had established policies, procedures, and systems

' See also Regulatory Notice 05-48 (“[A]ny third-party service providers conducting activities or functions that
require registration and qualification under [FINRA] rules will generally be considered associated persons of the
member and be required to have all necessary registrations and qualifications.”).

prohibiting call center personnel who were not registered from addressing transaction
requests involving Transamerica variable products.

Therefore, TCI violated FINRA Rules 1210 and 2010.
B. Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
. a censure; and
. a $500,000 fine.
Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an

instituted pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and

Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:

Summary

These proceedings arise out of the failure of Respondent, a registered investment adviser, to
adopt and implement reasonably designed compliance policies and procedures as required by
Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder. This violation persisted over
multiple years, including after Respondent was put on notice of multiple of these deficiencies in
connection with a Division of Examinations examination. Respondent also failed to conduct best
execution reviews of third-party service providers in violation of Section 206(2) of the Advisers
Act.

Respondent

1. E. Magnus Oppenheim & Co. Inc. is a New York corporation with its principal
place of business in New York, New York. Respondent has been registered with the Commission
as an investment adviser since 1978. It was also registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer
from 1979 until December 2022 when its registration terminated as a result of its filing of a Form
BDW. As of February 15, 2023, it has approximately $56 million of assets under management
and, according to its Form ADV, invests on behalf of about 95 clients with 95 accounts. The firm
was founded by E. Magnus Oppenheim who was the President, Chief Investment Officer, and Chief
Compliance Officer until he passed away on June 19, 2019. Shortly thereafter, an interim
compliance officer was hired from a third party service, and E. Magnus Oppenheim Revocable
Trust became the majority owner of the firm. Day-to-day management of the firm was assumed by
a portfolio manager who had been with the firm since 2005 and an administrative employee who
had been with the firm since 2008. Respondent offers discretionary portfolio management services.
It has both individual clients and a private fund client, E.M.O. Sterling Return LT Fund. The
Division of Examinations conducted recent examinations of Respondent in 2019 and 2021. In
May 2022, E. Magnus Oppenheim Revocable Trust entered into an agreement (the “Stock Purchase
Agreement’) to sell its interest in Respondent to another entity (“New Owner”). The Stock
Purchase Agreement was amended in October 2022 and January 2023, and the transaction it
contemplated (the “Sale”) closed on January 20, 2023. Following the Sale, New Owner’s Chief
Compliance Officer has become Chief Compliance Officer of Respondent.

Background

Failure to Adopt and Implement Reasonably Designed Compliance Policies and Procedures

2. Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7(a) thereunder require an
investment adviser that is registered or required to be registered to adopt and implement written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations by the adviser and its supervised
persons of the Advisers Act and the rules adopted thereunder.

3. Prior to 2019, Respondent’s written compliance policies and procedures were
principally oriented towards broker-dealer activities rather than the investment advisory business.
Among other things, these policies and procedures referenced outdated regulatory guidance from
the National Association of Securities Dealers, which had ceased to exist in 2007, and only
mentioned the Advisers Act once.

4. From 2019 to 2021, Respondent adopted as its written compliance policies and
procedures (“Compliance Manual’) another investment adviser’s compliance manual without
removing references to the other adviser and failed to tailor the manual to its own business,
including leaving in references to research analysts that it did not employ.

5. The Compliance Manual did not include policies and procedures reasonably
designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act in areas that were relevant to Respondent’s
business and operations, including policies and procedures involving access to client funds and
custody, political contributions made by Respondent or its covered associates, valuation of client
assets, billing fees, and conducting due diligence of third-party service providers. These were all
areas in which Respondent had been previously notified of deficiencies during the 2019
examination. Only upon inquiry by Division of Examinations staff in 2021 did Respondent insert
addenda relating to two areas that had not been addressed by its policies and procedures, Form
CRS and custody, and, in the latter instance, the addendum was itself deficient by virtue of failing
to address Respondent’s custody of client funds or securities with respect to the private fund it
manages. The 2019 examination also cited Respondent for failing to establish procedures in the
event of the loss or incapacitation of key individuals, including Mr. Oppenheim, then Respondent’s
sole principal.

Failure to Fulfill Responsibility to Seek Best Execution

6. Section 206 of the Advisers Act establishes a fiduciary duty for investment advisers
to act for the benefit of their clients. This duty includes the requirement to seek the best execution
of client securities transactions. To fulfill that duty, investment advisers should periodically and
systematically evaluate the execution they are receiving for clients’ transactions. Respondent
represented to clients that commissions they paid would “comply with [Respondent’s] duty to
obtain ‘best execution.””

7. Even though a similar deficiency had been identified in the 2019 examination,
Respondent failed to make an adequate assessment of the commission rates, fees, or ticket charges
charged by its clearing broker, try to negotiate better terms with its clearing broker, or make an
adequate assessment of the commissions, fees, ticket charges, and execution quality available from
other clearing brokers.

Violations

8. As a result of the conduct described above in paragraphs 2 to 5, Respondent

willfully’ violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7(a) thereunder, which,
among other things, require that an investment adviser that is registered or required to be registered
adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations, by
the investment adviser or its supervised persons, of the Advisers Act and the rules adopted
thereunder. A violation of Section 206(4) and the rules thereunder does not require scienter. SEC
v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 647 (D.C. Cir. 1992).

9. As a result of the conduct described above in paragraphs 6 to 7, Respondent
willfully violated Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act, which prohibits investment advisers from
directly or indirectly engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as
a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client. A violation of Section 206(2) may rest on a
finding of simple negligence. See SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 643 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citing
SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 195 (1963)).

Undertakings

Respondent has undertaken to:

10. Independent Compliance Consultant

a. Within 90 days of the entry of this Order, Respondent shall retain the services of an
independent compliance consultant (“Independent Consultant”) not unacceptable to
the Commission staff. Respondent shall require that the Independent Consultant
conduct a review of the compliance policies and procedures designed to promote
Respondent’s compliance with the Advisers Act and rules thereunder with respect
to Respondent. The Independent Consultant’s review shall be limited to the issues
identified in Respondent’s 2021 examination. Furthermore, the Independent
Consultant’s review shall be limited to the compliance policies and procedures
applied by the New Owner to business conducted through the entity now known as
E. Magnus Oppenheim & Co. Inc., and shall not encompass any other of the New
Owner’s businesses.

| «Willfully,” for purposes of imposing relief under Sections 15(b) of the Exchange Act and
203(e) of the Advisers Act, “‘means no more than that the person charged with the duty knows
what he is doing.’”” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v.
SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949)). There is no requirement that the actor “also be aware
that he is violating one of the Rules or Acts.” Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965). The
decision in The Robare Group, Ltd. v. SEC, which construed the term “willfully” for purposes of
a differently structured statutory provision, does not alter that standard. 922 F.3d 468, 478-79
(D.C. Cir. 2019) (setting forth the showing required to establish that a person has “willfully
omit[ted]” material information from a required disclosure in violation of Section 207 of the
Advisers Act).

b. Respondent shall provide to the Commission staff, within 90 days of the entry of
this Order, a copy of the engagement letter detailing the Independent Consultant’s
responsibilities.

c. Respondent shall require the Independent Consultant to submit a written report to
Respondent and to Commission staff within 180 days of the entry of this Order (the
“Report”). The Report shall describe in detail (1) the Independent Consultant’s
review, findings, conclusions, and recommendations, if any; (2) any proposals
made by Respondent; and (3) a procedure for Respondent to adopt and implement
any recommended changes in or improvements to its policies and procedures.

d. Within 90 days of receipt of the Report, Respondent shall adopt and implement any
recommendations contained in the report; provided, however, that within 30 days of
Respondent’s receipt of the Report, Respondent may, in writing, advise the
Independent Consultant and the Commission staff of any recommendations that it
considers unnecessary, unduly burdensome, impractical or inappropriate. With
respect to any such recommendation, Respondent need not adopt that
recommendation at that time but shall propose in writing an alternative policy,
procedure or system designed to achieve the same objective or purpose, or shall
explain why such recommendation is unnecessary or inappropriate. As to any
recommendation on which Respondent and the Independent Consultant do not
agree, such parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement within 30 days
after Respondent provides the response described above. In the event that
Respondent and the Independent Consultant are unable to agree on whether a
recommendation is necessary or an alternative proposal, Respondent and the
Independent Consultant shall jointly confer with the Commission staff to resolve
the matter. In the event that, after conferring with the Commission staff,
Respondent and the Independent Consultant are unable to agree on an alternative
proposal, Respondent will abide by the recommendations of the Independent
Consultant.

e. Within 30 days of Respondent’s adoption of the recommendations in the Report, to
the extent the Independent Consultant makes any such recommendations and other
than those determined not to be required by Respondent and the Independent
Consultant or in consultation with the Commission staff, Respondent shall certify in
writing to the Independent Consultant and the Commission staff that it has adopted
and implemented the Independent Consultant’s recommendations in the Report.
Unless otherwise directed by the Commission staff, all Reports, certifications and
other documents required to be provided to the Commission staff shall be sent to
Steven G. Rawlings, Assistant Regional Director, Securities and Exchange
Commission, New York Regional Office, 100 Pearl Street, Suite 20-100, New
York, NY 10004-2616, or such other address as the Commission’s staff may
provide.

f. As part of its work with the Independent Consultant, Respondent shall cooperate

5

fully and provide the Independent Consultant with access to files, books, records,
and personnel as are reasonably requested by the Independent Consultant for
review. Respondent shall bear all of the Independent Consultant’s compensation
and expenses.

g. To ensure the independence of the Independent Consultant, Respondent: (1) shall
not have the authority to terminate the Independent Consultant or substitute another
independent compliance consultant for the initial Independent Consultant, without
the prior written approval of the Commission staff; and (2) shall compensate the
Independent Consultant and persons engaged to assist the Independent Consultant
for services rendered pursuant to this Order at their reasonable and customary rates.

h. Respondent shall require the Independent Consultant to enter into an agreement
that provides that for the period of engagement and for a period of two years from
completion of the engagement, the Independent Consultant shall not enter into
any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional
relationship with Respondent, or any of its present or former affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity. The agreement will also
provide that the Independent Consultant will require that any firm with which
he/she is affiliated or of which he/she is a member, and any person engaged to
assist the Independent Consultant in performance of his/her duties under this
Order shall not, without prior written consent of the Commission staff, enter into
any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional
relationship with Respondent, or any of its present or former affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such for the period of the
engagement and for a period of two years after the engagement.

i. The reports by the Independent Consultant will likely include confidential
financial, proprietary, competitive business or commercial information. Public
disclosure of the reports could discourage cooperation, impede pending or
potential government investigations or undermine the objectives of the reporting
requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the contents
thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except (1) pursuant to
court order, (2) as agreed to by the parties in writing, (3) to the extent that the
Commission determines in its sole discretion that disclosure would be in
furtherance of the Commission’s discharge of its duties and responsibilities, or (4)
as otherwise required by law.

j. For good cause shown and upon timely application by Respondent, the
Commission staff may extend any of the procedural dates set forth in this
undertaking.

11. Respondent shall certify, in writing, its compliance with the undertaking set forth
above. The certification shall identify the undertaking, provide written evidence of compliance in
the form of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance. The

6

Commission staff may make reasonable requests for further evidence of compliance, and
Respondent agrees to provide such evidence. The certification and supporting material shall be
submitted to Steven G. Rawlings, Assistant Regional Director, with a copy to the Office of Chief
Counsel of the Enforcement Division, no later than sixty (60) days from the date of the completion
of the undertakings.

12. Respondent shall preserve, for a period of not less than six years from the entry of
this Order, the first two years in an easily accessible place, any record of compliance with the
undertaking set forth in this Order.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.

Accordingly, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and Sections 203(e) and
203(k) of the Advisers Act, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Respondent cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any
future violations of Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-
7 promulgated thereunder.

B. E. Magnus Oppenheim & Co. Inc. is censured.

C. Respondent shall comply with the undertakings enumerated in Section III,
paragraphs 10 to 12 above.

Dz. Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money
penalty in the amount of $50,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the
general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely
payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §3717. Payment must
be made in the manner provided in Subsection E below.

E. Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

() Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center

Accounts Receivable Branch

HQ Bidg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying E.
Magnus Oppenheim & Co. Inc. as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these
proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Sheldon Pollock,
Associate Regional Director, New York Regional Office, Securities and Exchange Commission,
100 Pearl Street, Suite 20-100, New York, NY 10004, or such other address as the Commission
staff may provide.

F. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action (""Penalty Offset""). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty
imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a ""Related Investor Action"" means a
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based
on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.

By the Commission.

RE: Maxim Group LLC, Respondent
CRD No. 120708

During the period between May 1, 2019 and the present (the “Relevant Period”), Maxim
Group LLC (“Maxim or the “Firm”) violated Securities Exchange Act Rule 15¢3-5(b),
(c)(1)@, and (c)(1)(ii) (Risk management controls for brokers or dealers with market
access) (“Rule 15¢3-5” or the “Market Access Rule”) by failing to establish, document, and
maintain a system of risk management controls and supervisory procedures reasonably
designed to manage the financial and regulatory risk of its business activity. Specifically,
the Firm had unreasonable credit limits and erroneous order controls. In addition, the
Firm violated NYSE Arca Rule 11.18(b) and (c) (Supervision) by failing to establish and
maintain a supervisory system and written supervisory procedures reasonably designed to
achieve compliance with the Market Access Rule. Consent to a censure and a $40,000 fine.

* * *

Pursuant to Rule 10.9216 of the NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca” or the “Exchange”) Code of
Procedure, Maxim submits this Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (“AWC”) for the
purpose of proposing a settlement of the alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is
submitted on the condition that, if accepted, NYSE Arca will not bring any future actions against
the Firm alleging violations based on the same factual findings described herein.

I. ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

A. Maxim hereby accepts and consents, without admitting or denying the findings, and
solely for the purposes of this proceeding and any other proceeding brought by or on
behalf of NYSE Arca, or to which NYSE Arca is a party, prior to a hearing and without
an adjudication of any issue of law or fact, to the entry of the following findings by
NYSE Arca:

BACKGROUND AND JURISDICTION
1. Maxim became registered as an Equities Trading Permit (“ETP”) holder with NYSE

Arca on March 19, 2003 and its registrations remain in effect. Among other services,
Maxim provides market access on an agency basis to institutional customers.

VIOLATIONS

Applicable Rules

2.

Rule 15c3-5 requires, among other things, that a broker-dealer with market access
establish risk management controls and supervisory procedures that are reasonably
designed to limit the financial exposure of the broker-dealer and ensure compliance
with all regulatory requirements applicable to market access.

Rule 15c3-5(b) requires that a broker or dealer with market access, or that provides a
customer with market access, “shall establish, document, and maintain a system of
risk management controls and supervisory procedures reasonably designed to manage
the financial, regulatory, and other risks of this business activity.”

Rule 15c3-5(c), requires a broker or dealer with market access, or that provides a
customer with market access, to design reasonable controls and supervisory
procedures to “[p]revent the entry of orders that exceed pre-set aggregate credit
thresholds for each customer” and to “[p]revent the entry of erroneous orders by
rejecting orders that exceed appropriate price or size parameters.”

NYSE Arca Rule 11.18(b) requires member firms to “establish and maintain a system
to supervise the activities of its associated persons and the operations of its business.
Such system must be reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable
federal securities laws and regulations and NYSE Arca Rules.” NYSE Arca Rule
11.18(c) requires each member firm to “establish, maintain, and enforce written
procedures to supervise the business in which it engages and to supervise the
activities of its associated persons that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance
with applicable federal securities laws and regulations, and with the NYSE Arca
Rules.”

Maxim’s Customer Credit Limits

6.

Rule 15c3-5(c)(1)(i) requires that a broker-dealer’s risk management controls and
supervisory procedures be reasonably designed to “prevent the entry of orders that
exceed appropriate pre-set credit or capital thresholds in the aggregate for each
customer.” The Market Access Rule’s Adopting Release explains that these
thresholds should be determined “based on appropriate due diligence as to the
customer’s business, financial condition, trading patterns, and other matters,” and that
a broker-dealer must “document that decision.” Adopting Release at 39.

During the Relevant Period, Maxim failed to apply reasonable credit thresholds to
certain of its institutional customers and failed to maintain sufficient documentation
to support that such credit thresholds were reasonable. For example, Maxim set an
unreasonably high credit threshold for an institutional customer with a daily notional
amount of $800 million, despite the fact that the highest total daily notional value of
orders executed on a per customer basis during the Relevant Period was $50 million.

Maxim also failed to reasonably enforce its supervisory processes and written

2

supervisory procedures (“WSPs’’) concerning the Market Access Rule’s credit
threshold requirements. For example, the Firm failed in certain instances to (i) follow
the methodology set forth in its procedures concerning credit thresholds and (ii)
create and retain documents to sufficiently memorialize its basis or rationale when
setting credit thresholds for certain institutional clients.

Based on the foregoing, the Firm violated Rule 15c3-5(b) and 15c3-5(c)(1)(i), as well
as NYSE Arca Rule 11.18(c).

Maxim’s Erroneous Order Controls

15.

16.

Rule15c3-5(c)(1)(ii) requires that a broker-dealer’s risk management controls and
supervisory procedures be reasonably designed to . . . [p]revent the entry of erroneous
orders, by rejecting orders that exceed appropriate price or size parameters, on an
order-by-order basis or over a short period of time, or that indicate duplicative
orders.”

. During the Relevant Period, certain of the Firm’s erroneous order controls were not

reasonably designed to prevent the entry of erroneous orders by rejecting orders that
exceeded appropriate price or size parameters. In addition, the Firm failed to
document why the controls related to order size and price were reasonable.

For example, the Firm set its Average Daily Volume (“ADV”) control at 50% for all
securities routed to NYSE Arca and price deviation control at 25% for all securities
routed to NYSE Arca. While the Firm’s Market Access Committee reviewed these
controls on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they remained unreasonably high and the
Firm failed to provide a basis or justification, including documentation,
demonstrating that these controls were reasonable.

Moreover, the Firm’s erroneous order controls were soft blocks that traders could
override. However, while the Firm’s policies and training materials mandated that a
trader confirm the accuracy of an order prior to releasing that order to market, they
did not include reasonable detail on how that review should take place. In addition,
the Firm’s supervisory review of soft block overrides took place on an aggregate,
exchange basis which is not reasonable to meet the requirements of the rule.

Based on the foregoing, the Firm violated Rule 15c3-5(b) and 15c3-5(c)(1)(ii), as
well as NYSE Arca Rule 11.18(b) and (c).

RELEVANT PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY
On April 22, 2019, Maxim consented to censure, a $450,000 fine, and an undertaking
for violations of Rule 15c3-5 and NYSE Arca Rule 11.18 (the “2019 Settlement”).
See NYSE Arca Matter No. 2016-12-00089.
OTHER FACTORS CONSIDERED

In determining to resolve this matter on the basis set forth herein, NYSE Regulation

3

Enforcement took into consideration that the Firm took significant remedial action
after the 2019 Settlement.

SANCTIONS
B. The Firm also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
1. Censure and fine in the amount of $40,000.
The Firm agrees to pay the monetary sanction(s) upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment(s) are due and payable. The Firm has submitted a
Method of Payment Confirmation form showing the method by which it will pay the fine

imposed.

The Firm specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that it is unable to pay,
now or at any time hereafter, the monetary sanction(s) imposed in this matter.

The sanctions imposed herein shall be effective on a date set by NYSE Regulation staff.
Il. WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS

The Firm specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under the NYSE Arca
Code of Procedure:

A. To have a Formal Complaint issued specifying the allegations against the Firm;

B. To be notified of the Formal Complaint and have the opportunity to answer the
allegations in writing;

C. To defend against the allegations in a disciplinary hearing before a hearing panel,

ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

A. Respondents accept and consent to the following findings by FINRA without admitting or

BACKGROUND

NatAlliance Securities, LLC has been a FINRA member firm since 1997. It is a full-service
broker-dealer, headquartered in Austin, Texas, that employs 66 registered representatives
across thirteen branches. !

Jason Adams entered the securities industry in 1996 and first registered with FINRA as a
General Securities Representative in April 1996. In January 2019, Adams registered as a
General Securities Representative and General Securities Principal through an association
with NatAlliance. Adams remains associated with the firm.”

OVERVIEW

From January 2019 through the present, NatAlliance failed to establish and maintain a
supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, reasonably designed to
review its traders’ bond marks to ensure accurate books and records, in violation of FINRA
Rules 3110 and 2010. From April 2020 through September 2020, Trader A, a former
NatAlliance proprietary corporate bond trader, inaccurately marked the value of numerous
bonds in his trading book.* Due to Trader A’s mismarking, NatAlliance failed to make and
keep accurate books and records of the firm’s net capital, thereby filing four inaccurate
monthly FOCUS reports between April 2020 and July 2020, in violation of Section 17(a) of
the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5, and FINRA Rules 4511 and 2010.
From April 2020 through September 2020, Adams failed to reasonably supervise Trader A,
in violation of FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This matter originated from FINRA’s review of the Uniform Termination Notice for
Securities Industry Registration (Form US) filed by NatAlliance for Trader A.

The SEC’s Net Capital Rule, Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule
15c3-1, requires broker-dealers to maintain net capital on a moment-to-moment basis. In
calculating its net capital, a broker-dealer on a daily basis must estimate the fair value of—
or “mark to market”—any bonds owned by the firm, thereby reflecting unrealized gains and
losses of the bonds’ value in the firm’s books and records. Bond traders typically mark to
market the positions in their book at the end of each trading day by referring, among other
things, to the price of recent comparable transactions displayed on FINRA’s Trade
Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), independent third-party pricing services, and
quotes from other dealers. Firms, in turn, record the traders’ marks in their books and
records when calculating net capital and making other financial computations.

Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act requires firms to make, keep, and furnish records of their
operations as the SEC, by rule, prescribes as necessary and appropriate in the public interest
and for the protection of investors. Exchange Act Rule 17a-3 requires firms to make and
keep accurate books and records reflecting all assets and liabilities and income and
expenses, including net capital calculations. Exchange Act Rule 17a-5 requires firms to
timely file accurate Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single (FOCUS) reports.
FINRA Rule 4511(a) requires members and associated persons to make and preserve
accurate books and records as required under FINRA rules, the Exchange Act, and the
applicable Exchange Act rules.

FINRA Rule 3110(a) requires a member firm to establish and maintain a system to supervise
the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules. FINRA
Rule 3110(b) requires a member firm to establish, maintain, and enforce written procedures

3 In October 2022, Trader A entered into an AWC for violating FINRA Rules 4511 and 2010, for which he was
suspended for fourmonths in all capacities and fined $5,000.

to supervise the types of business in which it engages and the activities of its associated
persons that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws
and regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules. The duty to supervise under Rule 3110
also includes the responsibility to reasonably investigate red flags that suggest that
misconduct may be occurring and to act upon the results of such investigation.

Violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5
thereunder, and FINRA Rules 3110 and 4511 are also violations of FINRA Rule 2010,
which requires member firms and associated persons to observe high standards of
commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade in the conduct of their business.

From January 2019 through the present, NatAlliance failed to establish and maintain a
supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, reasonably designed to
review traders’ end-of-day bond valuations.

In January 2019, Trader A and Adams joined NatAlliance after working together at a prior
firm where Adams supervised Trader A. At that time, NatAlliance began requiring all
traders to mark to market each bond in their trading book on a daily basis. NatAlliance did
not have a reasonably designed system in place to supervise that process. The firm generally
relied solely on its traders to determine the current fair market value of their bond inventory;
it failed to conduct any systematic review of the accuracy of its traders’ end-of-day
valuations and had no supervisory reviews to identify instances in which marks had not been
updated for extended periods.

In September 2020, the firm discovered that Trader A mismarked bonds and caused
inaccuracies in the firm’s books and records. Shortly thereafter, the firm enhanced its
supervision of traders’ marks, including implementing a price discrepancy report that flags
when a trader’s marks deviate from a pricing service quotation by certain thresholds. The
firm’s supervisory system, including written procedures, continues to not be reasonably
designed, however, because firm procedures do not explicitly require traders to review
marks daily, even though the marks are used for accounting and regulatory reporting
purposes. The firm procedures also do not require supervisory reviews to be conducted at
reasonable intervals, describe with any specificity the process for supervisory review, or
describe how to document supervisory reviews.

Therefore, NatAlliance violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.

Between April 2020 and September 2020, NatAlliance maintained inaccurate books
and records as a result of Trader A’s mismarking.

Between April 2020 and September 2020, Trader A, the firm’s largest trader based on
capital usage, recorded 8,847 inaccurate daily marks on 220 corporate bonds in his trading
book, primarily by failing to update marks for weeks or even months at a time. Trader A
thereby overstated the value of his portfolio ultimately by more than $2.6 million.

By virtue of Trader A’s mismarking, NatAlliance failed to make and keep accurate books
and records of the firm’s net capital and filed four inaccurate monthly FOCUS reports
between April 2020 and July 2020. Although the firm did not fall below its required

minimum net capital, the firm’s inaccurate monthly FOCUS Reports overstated its net
capital in each of the four months.

Therefore, NatAlliance violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rules
17a-3 and 17a-5, and FINRA Rules 4511 and 2010.

From April 2020 through September 2020, Adams failed to reasonably supervise
Trader A by not responding reasonably to red flags.

Adams, Director of Trading at NatAlliance, was Trader A’s direct supervisor and was
responsible for reviewing Trader A’s profit and loss. During Trader A’s employment at
NatAlliance, Adams verbally and in writing instructed Trader A to mark to market his
bonds on a daily basis. From April 2020 through September 2020, Adams was aware of
but did not respond reasonably to red flags that Trader A was mismarking bonds by not
appropriately updating his marks. On several occasions, Adams identified discrepancies
between Trader A’s marks and market prices. Adams instructed Trader A to value his
inventory positions accurately but did not follow-up to verify whether Trader A had
updated his marks, did not escalate to anyone else in management that Trader A’s marks
appeared to be inaccurate, and did not promptly take any disciplinary action against Trader
A.

Therefore, Adams violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.
Respondents also consent to the imposition of the following sanctions:

NatAlliance Securities, LLC:

. a censure;
. a $40,000 fine; and

s an undertaking that, within 90 days of the date of the notice of acceptance of this
AWC, a member of NatAlliance’s senior management who is a registered principal
of the firm shall certify in writing that, as of the date of the certification, the firm has
remediated the issues identified in this AWC and implemented a supervisory system,
including written supervisory procedures, reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and
17a-5, and FINRA Rule 4511 regarding the issues identified in this AWC. The
certification shall include a narrative description and supporting exhibits sufficient to
demonstrate NatAlliance’s remediation and implementation. FINRA staff may
request further evidence of NatAlliance’s remediation and implementation, and
NatA lliance agrees to provide such evidence. Respondent shall submit the
certification to Sathish Dhandayutham, Counsel, FINRA Department of
Enforcement, 15200 Omega Drive, Suite 300, Rockville, MD 20850, and by email to
sathish.dhandayutham@finra.org, with a copy to EnforcementNotice@finra.org.
Upon written request showing good cause, FINRA staff may extend this deadline.

Jason Adams:

7 a two-month suspension from associating with any FINRA member in all principal
capacities;

. a $5,000 fine; and

. a requirement that within 90 days of the Notice of Acceptance of this AWC, Adams
will attend and satisfactorily complete twenty hours of continuing education
concerning supervisory responsibilities by a provider not unacceptable to FINRA.
Adams will notify Sathish Dhandayutham, Counsel, of the name and contact
information of the provider who is providing the continuing education at least ten
days prior to attending the training. Within 30 days following the completion of the
twenty hours of continuing education, Adams will submit written proof that the
continuing education program has been satisfactorily completed to Sathish
Dhandayutham, Counsel, FINRA Department of Enforcement, 15200 Omega Drive,
Suite 300, Rockville, MD 20850, and by email to sathish.dhandayutham@finra.org,
with a copy to EnforcementNotice@finra.org. All correspondence must identify
Respondent Adams and Matter Number 2020068495402. Upon written request
showing good cause, FINRA staff may extend the procedural dates related to this
continuing-education requirement.

Respondents agree to pay the monetary sanctions upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payments are due and payable. NatAlliance and Adams have each
submitted an Election of Payment form showing the method by which they propose to pay
the fine imposed. Respondents specifically and voluntarily waive any right to claim an
inability to pay, now or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanctions
imposed in this matter.

Respondent Adams understands that if he is barred or suspended from associating with any
FINRA member in a principal capacity, he becomes subject to a statutory disqualification as
that term is defined in Article III, Section 4 of FINRA’s By-Laws, incorporating Section
3(a)(39) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, Respondent Adams may not
be associated with any FINRA member in a principal capacity, during the period of the bar
or suspension. See FINRA Rules 8310 and 8311. Furthermore, because Respondent Adams
is subject to a statutory disqualification during the suspension, if he remains associated with
a member firm in a non-suspended capacity, an application to continue that association may
be required.

The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.

IL.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS

Respondents specifically and voluntarily waive the following rights granted under FINRA’s Code
of Procedure:

A. To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against them;

B. To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations in
writing;

C. To defend against the allegations in a disciplinary hearing before a hearing panel, to

have a written record of the hearing made, and to have a written decision issued; and

D. To appeal any such decision to the National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) and then to
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court of Appeals.

Further, Respondents specifically and voluntarily waive any right to claim bias or prejudgment of
the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such person’s or
body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC, or other
consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.

Respondents further specifically and voluntarily waive any right to claim that a person violated the
ex parte prohibitions of FINRA Rule 9143 or the separation of functions prohibitions of FINRA
Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the
terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or
rejection.

NAC, or the Office of Disciplinary Affairs (ODA), pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216;

B. If this AWC is not accepted, its submission will not be used as evidence to prove any

Cc. If accepted:

1. this AWC will become part of Respondents’ permanent disciplinary record

in this provision affects Respondents’ testimonial obligations in any litigation
or other legal proceedings.

ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

A. Respondent hereby accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without

BACKGROUND

Newbridge has been a FINRA member since 2000 and is headquartered in Boca Raton,
Florida. Newbridge engages in general securities business and has approximately 195
registered representatives and 49 branch offices throughout the United States.

In September 2019, in AWC No. 2016047569601, Newbridge was censured and fined
$225,000 by FINRA in connection with, among other violations, its failure to: (1)
establish, maintain and enforce a supervisory system and written supervisory procedures
concerning the sale of complex securities, such as structured notes and non-traditional
exchange-traded funds, that were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with
FINRA’s suitability rule, in violation of NASD Rule 3010 and FINRA Rules 3110 and
2010, and (2) conduct reasonable due diligence of a private placement and reasonably
supervise the offering, and its failure to establish, maintain and enforce written
supervisory procedures concerning the due diligence required for private placements, in
violation of FINRA Rules 2111, 3110 and 2010.'

OVERVIEW

Between October 25, 2016 and February 8, 2018, Newbridge failed to reasonably
supervise representatives’ recommendations of an alternative mutual fund—the LIM
Preservation & Growth Fund (LJM).” Newbridge permitted the sale of LJM on its
platform without conducting reasonable due diligence and without a sufficient
understanding of its risks and features, including the fact that the fund pursued a risky
strategy that relied, in part, on purchasing uncovered options. Newbridge also lacked a
reasonable supervisory system to review representatives’ LJM recommendations.
Newbridge representatives sold approximately $323,000 in LJM to customers. LJM’s
value dropped 80% during an extreme volatility event in February 2018 and the fund
ultimately liquidated and closed, resulting in thousands of dollars in losses for
Newbridge’s customers. By virtue of the foregoing, Newbridge violated FINRA Rules
3110 and 2010.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This matter originated from FINRA’s 2019 investigation of firms that sold LJM to retail
customers.

Alternative Mutual Funds

Alternative mutual funds are publicly-offered mutual funds that seek to accomplish the
funds’ objectives through non-traditional investments and trading strategies. In its 2015
National Examination Priorities Letter, FINRA described the features of alternative
mutual funds:

Alternative mutual funds are often marketed as a way for retail customers
to invest in sophisticated, actively-managed hedge fund-like strategies that
will perform well in a variety of market environments. Alternative mutual
funds generally purport to reduce volatility, increase diversification, and
produce non-correlated returns and higher yields compared to traditional
long-only equity and fixed-income funds, all while offering daily liquidity.

In the same letter, FINRA identified alternative mutual funds as an area of review and
noted concerns regarding firms’ supervision and sale of such funds:

Despite their possible benefits, alternative mutual funds raise concerns
when compared to conventional funds. In particular, FINRA is concerned
that registered representatives and customers will not understand how the
funds will respond to various market conditions or even the strategy in
which the fund’s adviser will engage in various market scenarios. In
addition, FINRA has learned that some firms are not reviewing alt funds

? Ticker symbols were LIMIX, LIMCX, and LIMAX.

through their new-product review process, especially if the firm already
has an existing agreement with the fund company.

Previously, FINRA issued Regulatory Notices highlighting the risks of “complex
products,” such as alternative mutual funds, and stressing the need for firms and their
representatives to understand their unique risks and features before recommending them,
particularly to retail customers.?

LJM and the Risks of an Uncovered Options Strategy

LJM was an alternative mutual fund that launched on January 9, 2013. LJM marketed
itself as “selling volatility” by seeking to profit from the “volatility premium’”—the
difference between implied volatility (investors’ forecast of market volatility reflected in
options pricing) and realized (actual) market volatility. To achieve this goal, LIM
invested primarily in purchased (long) and sold (short) call and put options on the S&P
500 futures index. LJM did not hold any underlying stock as a part of its strategy.

In its prospectus, LJM disclosed that “[iJn the aggregate, the Fund is typically ‘net short’
in the portfolio of contracts that it holds, which means the Fund holds more uncovered
option contracts than covered.” The prospectus also disclosed the limited upside, and
unlimited downside, risk associated with uncovered options.

The fact that LJM was typically “net short” or “short volatility” was also disclosed in
various informational and marketing materials provided, or available, to registered
representatives and their firms. This material disclosed that there were certain markets in
which LJM was designed to do well, namely: (1) flat, (ii) choppy, (iii) eroding, or

(iv) slowing rising or falling markets. Conversely, LJM disclosed that there were other
markets in which its strategy would be “challenged,” namely: (i) sustained upward-
trending equity markets, (ii) quick reversals, or (iii) extreme volatility spikes or market
moves. LJM employed a risk mitigation strategy through the use of put option spreads

3 In January 2012, FINRA issued Regulatory Notice 12-03 regarding supervisory procedures governing “complex
products.” In it, FINRA provided guidance to firms on the characteristics of complex products:

Any product with multiple features that affect its investment returns differently under various
scenarios is potentially complex. This is particularly true if it would be unreasonable to expect an
average retail investor to discern the existence of these features and to understand the basic
manner in which these features interact to produce an investment return.

FINRA provided several examples of complex products, including “exchange-traded products [that] offer retail
investors exposure to stock market volatility. ... The investable form of volatility may be in the form of futures on
the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) that reflect the market’s expectation of volatility.” FINRA stated that “complex”
products present additional risk to retail investors.

Similarly, in June 2013, FINRA issued an Investor Alert, “Alternative Funds Are Not Your Typical Mutual Funds,”
noting among other things: (1) in addition to the usual market and investment specific risks mutual funds have,
alternative mutual funds carry additional risks from the strategies they use; and (2) many alternative mutual funds
have limited performance histories, making it difficult to predict how they will perform in various market
conditions, including downturns.

that was intended to mitigate the risks associated with the challenging markets, including
major market downturns. However, LJM disclosed in its prospectus that “there can be no
assurance that the Fund’s risk mitigation strategies will reduce risk or will be either
available or cost effective.”

In July 2017, Morningstar issued a Fund Report for LJM that described the fund as “[a]n
aggressive option seller with above-average returns and low correlation with equity
markets, but high risk.” The Report further stated that “[t]he strategy is structured to
generate high income but is relatively aggressive and exposed to a steep rise in equity
volatility. Even though these volatility spikes and periods of heightened uncertainty are
infrequent, they could have significant, negative impact on this fund’s future
performance.”

The Firm Did Not Have a Reasonably Designed Supervisory System with Respect to
the Recommendation of Alternative Mutual Funds.

FINRA Rule 3110 sets forth FINRA members’ supervisory obligations. Subsection (a)
requires that each member shall establish and maintain a system to supervise the
activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules.
Subsection (b) requires that each member shall establish, maintain, and enforce written
procedures to supervise the types of business in which it engages and the activities of its
associated persons that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable
securities laws and regulations, and with the applicable FINRA rules. Violations of
FINRA Rule 3110 also constitute violations of FINRA Rule 2010.

FINRA Rule 2111 requires:

a member or associated person to have a reasonable basis to believe, based
on reasonable diligence, that the recommendation is suitable for at least
some investors. In general, what constitutes reasonable diligence will vary
depending on, among other things, the complexity of and risks associated
with the security or investment strategy and the member’s or associated
person’s familiarity with the security or investment strategy. A member’s
or associated person’s reasonable diligence must provide the member or
associated person with an understanding of the potential risks and rewards
associated with the recommended security or strategy. The lack of such an
understanding when recommending a security or strategy violates the
suitability rule.4

Newbridge’s supervision of its representatives’ recommendations of alternative mutual
funds was not reasonable in several respects.

First, the firm had no system or procedures to determine whether a new mutual fund
constituted a “complex product” or was an alternative mutual fund, such that heightened

4 FINRA Rule 2111.05(a) (Supplementary Material to Rule 2111).
4

due diligence of the product may be appropriate. Rather, in reviewing and approving new
alternative mutual funds, the firm subjected them to the same standards as traditional
mutual funds, which did not evaluate the potential risks and rewards associated with the
strategy of the funds. The firm relied solely on the due diligence conducted by the
clearing firm to approve mutual funds on the clearing firm platform and did not conduct
any independent due diligence of LJM.

Second, the firm did not provide adequate guidance or training to representatives
regarding the risks and features of alternative mutual funds and did not have written
supervisory procedures advising firm principals how to supervise recommendations of
alternative mutual funds.

Third, the firm utilized an electronic trade review system to assess the suitability of
mutual fund transactions. However, the firm failed to consider whether the rules of the
review system pertaining to traditional mutual funds were reasonable to review
alternative mutual funds, or whether to modify the rules to address particular risks and
characteristics of alternative mutual funds, including LJM. As a result, Newbridge’s LIM
transactions were approved via the trade system’s auto-approval function, i.e., with no
principal reviewing for suitability.

As LJM was a publicly-offered fund, Newbridge did not review LJM’s investment and
trading strategy as part of a new product approval process, and the firm similarly did not
impose any limitations on the sale of LIM. Newbridge’s first sale of LJM occurred in
October 2016, and the last occurred in November 2017. During that time, Newbridge
representatives sold approximately $323,000 in shares of LJM to ten customers.

On February 5, 2018, the S&P 500 fell 113 points (around 4.1%), which contributed to an
unprecedented increase in market volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index
(VIX). On February 5, 2018, the VIX more than doubled from 17 to 37, which at that
time was the largest one day rise in its history. As a result of the market’s increased
volatility, the prices of the short option positions sold by LJM increased dramatically. On
February 5 and 6, 2018, LJM lost about 80% of its value. On February 7, LJM announced
that it was closing itself to new investors, and on March 29, 2018, LJM was liquidated
and dissolved. Investors who held shares as of February 6, 2018 lost approximately 80%
of their investment.

Based on the above, Newbridge violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.
Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
. a censure;

. a $50,000 fine;

7 restitution of $114,025.24 plus interest as described below; and

7 an undertaking that, within 90 days of notice of acceptance of this AWC, a
member of Respondent’s senior management who is a registered principal of the
firm shall certify in writing that, as of the date of the certification, the firm has
remediated the issues identified in this AWC and implemented a supervisory
system, including written supervisory procedures, reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with Rule 3110 and 2010, regarding the issues identified in this
AWC. The certification shall include a narrative description and supporting
exhibits sufficient to demonstrate Respondent’s remediation and implementation.
FINRA staff may request further evidence of Respondent’s remediation and
implementation, and Respondent agrees to provide such evidence. Respondent
shall submit the certification to Sean Heikkila, Counsel, FINRA Department of
Enforcement, Brookfield Place, 200 Liberty Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY
10281-1003, with a copy to EnforcementNotice@finra.org. Upon written request
showing good cause, FINRA staff may extend this deadline.

Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.

Restitution is ordered to be paid to the customers listed on Attachment A to this AWC
(“Eligible Customers”) in the total amount of $114,025.24, plus interest at the rate set
forth in Section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 6621(a)(2), from
March 29, 2018 until February 28, 2019.

A registered principal on behalf of Respondent shall submit satisfactory proof of payment
of restitution and interest (separately specifying the date and amount of each Eligible
Customer) or of reasonable and documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution. Such
proof shall be submitted by email to EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org from a work-
related account of the registered principal of Respondent. The email must identify
Respondent and the case number and include a copy of the check, money order, or other
method of payment. This proof shall be provided by email to
EnforcementNotice@FINRA.org no later than 120 days after the date of the notice of
acceptance of the AWC.

The restitution amount plus interest to be paid to each Eligible Customer shall be treated
by the Respondent as the Eligible Customer’s property for purposes of state escheatment,
unclaimed property, abandoned property, and similar laws. If after reasonable and
documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution Respondent is unable to pay all
Eligible Customers within 120 days after the date of the notice of acceptance of the
AWC, Respondent shall submit to FINRA in the manner described above a list of the
unpaid Eligible Customers and a description of Respondent’s plan, not unacceptable to
FINRA, to comply with the applicable escheatment, unclaimed property, abandoned
property, or similar laws for each such Eligible Customer.

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanctions imposed in this
matter.

The imposition of a restitution order or any other monetary sanction in this AWC, and the
timing of such ordered payments, does not preclude customers from pursuing their own
actions to obtain restitution or other remedies.

Restitution payments to customers shall be preceded or accompanied by a letter, not
unacceptable to FINRA, describing the reason for the payment and the fact that the
payment is being made pursuant to a settlement with FINRA and as a term of this AWC.

The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.

II.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:

A. To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against it;

B. To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations
in writing;

to have a written record of the hearing made, and to have a written decision
issued; and

D. To appeal any such decision to the NAC and then to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court of Appeals.

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such
person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. violated NYSE American Rule 16 (Business Conduct) by
failing to adhere to principles of good business practice in its handling of a customer
options order on March 8, 2022. Consent to a censure and $45,000 fine.

* * *

Pursuant to Rule 9216 of the NYSE American LLC (“NYSE American” or the “Exchange’’)
Code of Procedure, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (““CGMI” or the “Firm”) submits this Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (“AWC”) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, NYSE American will not bring any future actions against the Firm alleging violations
based on the same factual findings described herein.

I. ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

A. CGM hereby accepts and consents, without admitting or denying the findings, and solely
for the purposes of this proceeding and any other proceeding brought by or on behalf of
NYSE American, or to which NYSE American is a party, prior to a hearing and without
an adjudication of any issue of law or fact, to the entry of the following findings by
NYSE American:

BACKGROUND AND JURISDICTION

1. CGMLIis registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer
and investment adviser and has been a member of NYSE American since February
1988. Its principal place of business is in New York, New York.

VIOLATIONS

2. NYSE American Rule 16 requires every member and member organization to “at all
times adhere to the principles of good business practice in the conduct of its business
affairs”

3. On March 8, 2022, a trader on CGMI’s Equity Derivatives desk, who had worked in
the industry for approximately six months, received a customer order to buy 1,000
puts “best way,” with no price instruction. The CGMI trader then instructed a floor

broker on NYSE American to execute the order, with CGMI crossing 342 of the
1,000 contracts and the floor broker seeking liquidity for the remaining 658 contracts.

While the floor broker was seeking additional liquidity, the price of the options
contracts began increasing, and the CGMI trader instructed the floor broker, “just try
to get them done, we can stop them at 2.20.” The floor broker asked whether the
trader was “committed” at that price, which the CGMI trader mistakenly confirmed.
The floor broker executed three contracts electronically at $2.19 and systematized
the remaining 997 contracts at $2.20 with CGMI on the other side. The order was
announced in open outcry and released at 12:24:08 p.m.

. The CGMI trader then called the floor broker seeking to cancel the order at 12:24:29

p.m. The floor broker informed the CGMI trader that they had purchased three
contracts electronically, and that 50 contracts had traded in the trading crowd on the
NYSE American floor. The floor broker further told the CGMI trader that the trading
crowd would, “probably be okay busting that if you want to bust the whole trade,”
which should have served as an indication to the CGMI trader that the order had been
executed. The trader, however, confirmed he wanted to cancel the trade, believing
that it was an unexecuted order.

. The CGMI trader subsequently executed 997 contracts electronically for $2.55, a
worse price for the customer than the original $2.20 execution price, resulting in
$34,895 in harm to CGMI’s customer.

. Accordingly, CGMI failed to adhere to the principles of good business practice in
violation of NYSE American Rule 16.

RELEVANT PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY

On April 16, 2020, CGMI consented to a censure and fine of $95,000 for violating
NYSE American Rule 16 in connection with the handling of a customer options
order. See NYSE American Matter No. 2017-11-00111.

OTHER FACTORS CONSIDERED

In determining to resolve this matter on the basis set forth herein, NYSE Regulation
took into consideration, among other things, that the Firm offered restitution to its
customer in the amount of $34,895, which the customer accepted, and certain
remedial measures taken by the Firm.

SANCTIONS

The Firm also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:

. Censure and fine in the amount of $45,000

The Firm agrees to pay the monetary sanction(s) upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment(s) are due and payable. The Firm has submitted a

2

Method of Payment Confirmation form showing the method by which it will pay the fine
imposed.

The Firm specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that it is unable to pay,
now or at any time hereafter, the monetary sanction(s) imposed in this matter.

Il. WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS

The Firm specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under the NYSE
American Code of Procedure:

A. To have a Formal Complaint issued specifying the allegations against the Firm;

B. To be notified of the Formal Complaint and have the opportunity to answer the
allegations in writing;

C. To defend against the allegations in a disciplinary hearing before a hearing panel,
to have a written record of the hearing made and to have a written decision issued;
and

D. To appeal any such decision to the Exchange’s Board of Directors and then to the

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court of Appeals.

Further, the Firm specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment of
the Chief Regulatory Officer of NYSE American; the Exchange’s Board of Directors,
Disciplinary Action Committee (“DAC”), and Committee for Review (“CFR”); any Director,
DAC member, or CFR member; Counsel to the Exchange Board of Directors or CFR; any other
NYSE American employee; or any Regulatory Staff as defined in Rule 9120 in connection with
such person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this
AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including acceptance or rejection of this AWC.

The Firm further specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that a person violated the
ex parte communication prohibitions of Rule 9143 or the separation of functions prohibitions of
Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the
terms and conditions of this AWC, or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance
or rejection.

lil. OTHER MATTERS
The Firm understands that:

A. Submission of this AWC is voluntary and will not resolve this matter unless and
until it has been reviewed by NYSE Regulation, and accepted by the Chief
Regulatory Officer of NYSE American pursuant to NYSE American Rule 9216;

B. If this AWC is not accepted, its submission will not be used as evidence to prove
any of the allegations against the Firm; and

Cc. If accepted:

1. The AWC shall be sent to each Director and each member of the Committee
for Review via courier, express delivery or electronic means, and shall be
deemed final and shall constitute the complaint, answer, and decision in the
matter, 10 days after it is sent to each Director and each member of the
Committee for Review, unless review by the Exchange Board of Directors is
requested pursuant to NYSE American Rule 9310(a)(1)(B);

2. This AWC will become part of the Firm’s permanent disciplinary record and
may be considered in any future actions brought by the Exchange, or any
other regulator against the Firm;

3. NYSE American shall publish a copy of the AWC on its website in
accordance with NYSE American Rule 8313;

4. NYSE American may make a public announcement concerning this
agreement and the subject matter thereof in accordance with NYSE American
Rule 8313; and

5. The Firm may not take any action or make or permit to be made any public
statement, including in regulatory filings or otherwise, denying, directly or
indirectly, any finding in this AWC or create the impression that the AWC is
without factual basis. The Firm may not take any position in any proceeding
brought by or on behalf of the Exchange, or to which the Exchange is a party,
that is inconsistent with any part of this AWC. Nothing in this provision
affects the Firm’s (1) testimonial obligations; or (ii) right to take legal or
factual positions in litigation or other legal proceedings in which the
Exchange is not a party.

D. A signed copy of this AWC and the accompanying Method of Payment
Confirmation form delivered by email, facsimile or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy.

E. The Firm may attach a Corrective Action Statement to this AWC that is a
statement of demonstrable corrective steps taken to prevent future misconduct.
The Firm understands that it may not deny the charges or make any statement that
is inconsistent with the AWC in this Statement. Any such statement does not
constitute factual or legal findings by the Exchange, nor does it reflect the views
of NYSE Regulation or its staff.

The Firm certifies that, in connection with each of the Exchange’s requests for information in
connection with this matter, the Firm made a diligent inquiry of all persons and systems that
reasonably had possession of responsive documents and that all responsive documents have been
produced. In agreeing to the AWC, the Exchange has relied upon, among other things, the
completeness of the document productions.

The undersigned, on behalf of the Firm, certifies that a person duly authorized to act on its behalf
has read and understands all of the provisions of this AWC and has been given a full opportunity
to ask questions about it; that it has agreed to the AWC’s provisions voluntarily; and that no
offer, threat, inducement, or promise of any kind, other than the terms set forth herein and the
prospect of avoiding the issuance of a Complaint, has been made to induce the firm to submit it.

alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, NYSE Arca will not bring any future actions against the Firm alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described herein.

I ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

A. Oppenheimer hereby accepts and consents, without admitting or denying the findings,
and solely for the purposes of this proceeding and any other proceeding brought by or on
behalf of NYSE Arca, or to which NYSE Arca is a party, prior to a hearing and without
an adjudication of any issue of law or fact, to the entry of the following findings by
NYSE Arca:

BACKGROUND AND JURISDICTION

1, Oppenheimer is a corporation registered in the State of New York with its main office
located in New York, NY. The Firm has been a member of NYSE Arca since 2008
and is registered as a NYSE Arca Options Trading Permit (“OTP”) Firm. The Firm’s
options business is conducted solely in an agency capacity.

VIOLATIONS
Best Execution Violation

2. NYSE Arca Rule 11.1(b) requires member firms and their associated persons to
“adhere to the principles of good business practice in the conduct of its or their
business affairs.”

On April 19, 2022, at 15:49:10, a customer sent Oppenheimer an order to buy 8,000
puts and sell 4,000 puts (the “Order”). At 15:51:23, an Oppenheimer trader instructed
a floor broker on NYSE Arca to load the Order, and the floor broker systematized the
Order at 15:52:01.

The Oppenheimer trader solicited a potential liquidity provider to take the other side
of the Order, and the liquidity provider agreed to do so at $0.37.

At 15:54:45, the Oppenheimer trader instructed the floor broker to cross the trade at
$0.37: “.37 good.” At 15:54:46, the floor broker released the Order, and then, at
15:54:52, informed the Oppenheimer trader that the entire Order had traded at $0.37:
“u cross all.”

One second later, at 15:54:53, the Oppenheimer trader messaged the floor broker to
change the price and quantity that the solicited liquidity provider was willing to pay
for the trade: “.38 now” and “3629 [contracts].” Because the Order already had been
executed, the floor broker replied, “to[o] late.”

Without informing the liquidity provider that the Order had been executed at the
originally agreed upon $0.37 price, or obtaining the agreement of its customer, the
Oppenheimer trader instructed the floor broker to nullify and adjust the price of the
Order: “pay 0.44 for 3629x,” a worse price for Oppenheimer’s customer. The floor
broker systematized and released the new order.

The price adjustment resulted in $25,400 in harm to Oppenheimer’s customer.

At no point before the Order was adjusted from $0.37 to $0.44 did any Oppenheimer
representative obtain the agreement of its customer to nullify and adjust the price of
the Order. Oppenheimer first advised its customer about the price adjustment at
17:46, after the trading day.

. By failing to obtain the most advantageous terms for its customer on the Order, and

by failing to obtain the agreement of its customer prior to instructing the floor broker
to nullify and adjust the trade, Oppenheimer violated NYSE Arca Rule 11.1(b).

Supervisory Violations

il.

NYSE Arca Rule 11.18(b) requires member firms to “establish and maintain a system
to supervise the activities of its associated persons and the operations of its business”
that is “reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable federal securities
laws and regulations and NYSE Arca Rules.”

12.

16.

NYSE Arca Rule 11.18(c) requires member firms to “establish, maintain, and enforce
written procedures to supervise the business in which it engages and to supervise the
activities of its associated persons that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance
with applicable federal securities laws and regulations, and with the NYSE Arca
Rules.”

. The Firm failed to establish, maintain, and enforce a supervisory system and written

supervisory procedures (“WSPs”) reasonably designed to ensure compliance with its
obligations for certain customer options orders.

Specifically, the Firm did not have policies or procedures in place regarding its
obligations for the handling of not-held orders, including with respect to trade
nullification, such as the Order at issue here. The Oppenheimer desk that handled the
Order also did not follow Firm WSPs with respect to the Order because: (i) the desk
supervisor failed to provide prior approval of the trade nullification; (ii) the desk
failed to obtain prior customer agreement to the price adjustment; and (iii) the desk
supervisor did not notify the Firm’s regulatory supervisor of the trade nullification, as
required by the WSPs.

. Accordingly, the Firm violated NYSE Arca Rule 11.18(b) and (c).

RELEVANT PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY

In June 2021, Oppenheimer consented to a censure and fine of $175,000 for
violations of NYSE American Rule 16 (Business Conduct), NYSE American Rule
966NY (Trade Nullification and Price Adjustment Procedure), and NYSE American
Rule 320(e) (Offices—Approval, Supervision and Control) in connection with the
handling of two customer options orders. See NYSE Matter Nos. 2019-12-00063 &
2020-10-00012.

OTHER FACTORS CONSIDERED

. In connection with NYSE Regulation’s investigation, Oppenheimer offered the

customer restitution in the amount of $25,400.

SANCTIONS

The Firm also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:

Censure and fine in the amount of $90,000

The Firm agrees to pay the monetary sanction(s) upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment(s) are due and payable. The Firm has submitted a

imposed.

The Firm specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that it is unable to pay,
now or at any time hereafter, the monetary sanction(s) imposed in this matter.

Baker Tilly Capital, LLC (Respondent)
Member Firm
CRD No. 115333

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Baker Tilly Capital, LLC, submits this Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND

Baker Tilly Capital, LLC (BTC) has been a FINRA member since 2001. BTC is
headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. It has 8 branches and approximately 40 registered
representatives. The firm is a limited purpose broker-dealer and offers private placement
investment opportunities in real estate and other alternative investments to accredited
investors. !

OVERVIEW
In 2019, BTC permitted material changes to the terms of two related private placement
offerings without terminating the offerings and returning funds to investors. Therefore,
BTC willfully violated Exchange Act Rule 10b-9 and FINRA Rule 2010.
FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This matter originated from a cause examination by FINRA’s Corporate Financing
Department.

Exchange Act Rule 10b-9 requires, in connection with the sale of securities on an “all-or-
none” or “part or none” basis, disclosure to investors that consideration paid for securities

' For more information about the firm, visit BrokerCheck® at www. finra.org/brokercheck.

will be promptly refunded unless the minimum number of securities are sold at a
specified price within a specified time, and the total amount due to the seller is received
by a specified date. The offering “may not be considered ‘sold’ . . . unless all the
securities required to be placed are sold in bona fide transactions and are fully paid for.””
While not a guarantee, satisfaction of the minimum contingency indicates to investors
that the offering was priced fairly.

Any change in a material term of an “all-or-none” or “part or none” offering requires the
offering to be terminated and investor funds to be returned. Investors cannot waive this
requirement by affirmatively consenting to the changes, except to extend the termination
date of the offering. A broker-dealer that fails to terminate an offering following a
material change to the terms of an offering—including changing the minimum
contingency amount—violates Exchange Act Rule 10b-9.?

A violation of Exchange Act Rule 10b-9 is also a violation of FINRA Rule 2010, which
requires a member, in the conduct of its business, to observe high standards of
commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.

In 2019, BTC served as the private placement agent for two related private placements
(the offering). The offering raised funds for a real estate development in a federally
designated qualified opportunity zone. Investments in qualified opportunity zones may
provide tax benefits to investors, so long as their investment occurs within a certain time
period and satisfies other conditions.

In March 2019, the original private placement memorandum (PPM) for the offering
stated that a closing would not occur until the offering met a minimum contingency of
$16 million in investor subscriptions.

However, the issuer amended the PMM in June 2019 to state that an initial closing of
approximately $6 million would take place later that month. The issuer conducted the
June closing so that certain investors would not lose the tax benefits of their investment.*
Because the early closing was a material change to the terms of the offering, BTC was
required to, but did not, terminate the offering and return investor funds at that time.

Additionally, amendments to the PPM in June and August 2019 provided for the first
time that, in addition to investor subscriptions, alternative funding sources obtained by
the manager of the offering could count toward the minimum contingency amount. The
alternative funding could include deferred developer fees, a construction loan, and other
sources not involving investor subscriptions. Again, because this was a material change

2 SEC Rel. No. 33-11532, 1975 SEC LEXIS 1229 at *3 (July 11, 1975). See also FINRA Regulatory Notice 16-08
(Feb. 2016).

3 See FINRA Regulatory Notice 16-08 at p. 2 (Broker-dealers violate Rule 10b-9 “by failing to return subscriber
funds after the issuer changed the contingency by reducing the offering minimum.”).

4 The closing in June 2019 resulted in securities being issued to investors, but their funds remained in escrow until a
later closing in August 2019.

to the terms of the offering, BTC was required to, but did not, terminate the offering and
return investor funds at that time.

Ultimately, the issuer conducted a closing in August 2019 with only $10.925 million in
investor subscriptions, including $2.95 million raised for the June closing, below the
required $16 million minimum contingency.

Therefore, Respondent willfully violated Exchange Rule 10b-9 and FINRA Rule 2010.
B. Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:
. a censure and
. a $90,000 fine.
Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this
matter.
Respondent understands that this settlement includes a finding that it willfully violated
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that under Article III, Section 4
of FINRA’s By-Laws, this makes Respondent subject to a statutory disqualification with
respect to membership.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.
IL.
WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS

Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under FINRA’s
Code of Procedure:

A. To have a complaint issued specifying the allegations against it;

B. To be notified of the complaint and have the opportunity to answer the allegations
in writing;

C. To defend against the allegations in a disciplinary hearing before a hearing panel,
to have a written record of the hearing made, and to have a written decision
issued; and

D. To appeal any such decision to the National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) and
then to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.S. Court of
Appeals.

Further, Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim bias or prejudgment
of the Chief Legal Officer, the NAC, or any member of the NAC, in connection with such
person’s or body’s participation in discussions regarding the terms and conditions of this AWC,
or other consideration of this AWC, including its acceptance or rejection.

Respondent further specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that a person violated
the ex parte prohibitions of FINRA Rule 9143 or the separation of functions prohibitions of
FINRA Rule 9144, in connection with such person’s or body’s participation in discussions

its acceptance or rejection.

A. Submission of this AWC is voluntary and will not resolve this matter unless and

until it has been reviewed and accepted by the NAC, a Review Subcommittee of
the NAC, or the Office of Disciplinary Affairs (ODA), pursuant to FINRA Rule
9216;

B. If this AWC is not accepted, its submission will not be used as evidence to prove
any of the allegations against Respondent; and

C, If accepted:

1. this AWC will become part of Respondent’s permanent disciplinary
record and may be considered in any future action brought by FINRA or
any other regulator against Respondent;

2s this AWC will be made available through FINRA’s public disclosure
program in accordance with FINRA Rule 8313;

3. FINRA may make a public announcement concerning this agreement and
its subject matter in accordance with FINRA Rule 8313; and
4. Respondent may not take any action or make or permit to be made any

public statement, including in regulatory filings or otherwise, denying,
directly or indirectly, any finding in this AWC or create the impression
that the AWC is without factual basis. Respondent may not take any
position in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of FINRA, or to which
FINRA is a party, that is inconsistent with any part of this AWC. Nothing
in this provision affects Respondent’s right to take legal or factual

4

positions in litigation or other legal proceedings in which FINRA is not a
party. Nothing in this provision affects Respondent’s testimonial
obligations in any litigation or other legal proceedings.

Respondent may attach a corrective action statement to this AWC that is a
statement of demonstrable corrective steps taken to prevent future misconduct.
Respondent understands that it may not deny the charges or make any statement
that is inconsistent with the AWC in this statement. This statement does not
constitute factual or legal findings by FINRA, nor does it reflect the views of
FINRA.

The undersigned, on behalf of Respondent, certifies that a person duly authorized to act on
Respondent's behalf has read and understands all of the provisions of this AWC and has been
given a full opportunity to ask questions about it; that Respondent has agreed to the AWC’s
provisions voluntarily; and that no offer, threat, inducement, or promise of any kind, other than
the terms set forth in this AWC and the prospect of avoiding the issuance of a complaint, has

CRD No. 361

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC submits this Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, FINRA will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based
on the same factual findings described in this AWC.

I.
ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND

Goldman has been a FINRA member since October 1936. It is a full-service broker-
dealer engaged in market making, execution services, and underwriting. The firm is
headquartered in New York, New York and has approximately 8,500 registered
individuals among its headquarters and approximately 70 branches. !

OVERVIEW

From October 2015 to April 2018, Goldman mismarked as “long” approximately 60
million short sale orders totaling more than 14 billion shares. Nearly eight million of
those orders, totaling more than a billion shares, were executed. Due to the inaccurate
“long” mark, 12,335 of the executed orders were executed at or below the national best
bid while a short sale circuit breaker was in effect. These mismarked orders also caused
the firm to submit inaccurate trade reports to FINRA and maintain inaccurate books and
records. As a result, Goldman violated Rules 200(g) of Regulation SHO, Section 17(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 17a-3, and FINRA Rules
4511, 6182, 6624, and 2010.

' For more information about the firm, including prior regulatory events, visit BrokerCheck® at
www. finra.org/brokercheck.

During the relevant period, the firm further violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010 by
failing to establish and maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with Regulation SHO and rules relating to accurate trade reporting and order
memoranda.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT

This matter originated from a FINRA examination.
Goldman erroneously marked and routed certain sell orders.

Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO requires broker-dealers to “mark all sell orders of any
equity security as ‘long,’ ‘short,’ or ‘short exempt.’” The broker-dealer selling an equity
security may mark an order as “long” only if it is deemed to own the security being sold
and either (i) the security to be delivered is in the physical possession or control of the
broker or dealer; or (11) it is reasonably expected that the security will be in the physical
possession or control of the broker or dealer no later than the settlement of the
transaction. A violation of Rule 200(g) also constitutes a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.”

From October 2015 to April 2018, Goldman mismarked 59,981,252 short sell orders as
long, of which 26,944,700 were sent to an alternative trading system (ATS). These orders
represented less than one percent of Goldman’s total principal sell orders during this time
period. The orders were auto-generated to promptly hedge the Synthetic Product Group’s
(SPG) synthetic risk exposure resulting from its execution of equity swap transactions
with clients. The mismarked orders were caused by Goldman’s implementation of an
upgrade to the relevant automated trading software that was intended to simplify this
order flow. Goldman inadvertently failed to include a single line of code that was
designed to copy the long or short mark from a parent sell order and affix it to the
instantaneously created child sell order(s) that were routed to the market. While the
parent orders were accurately marked as short sales and a locate was obtained for each,
the child orders did not receive the short sale order mark of the parent order due to the
missing line of code. The firm immediately fixed this coding error after being notified by
FINRA in April 2018.

Separately, Goldman misapplied order marking logic to sell orders routed to the firm by a
foreign affiliate in a manner that resulted in certain of those orders being inaccurately
marked short. A sample of six months of data revealed that approximately 670 orders of
that foreign affiliate were broken up into child orders with the incorrect short sale
indicator and sent to various market centers resulting in 26,377 executions, including
6,176 sent to an ATS.? Goldman corrected this error after being notified by FINRA in
October 2019.

2 FINRA Rule 2010 provides that “[a] member, in the conduct of its business, shall observe high standards of
commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.” A violation of the Exchange Act, an Exchange Act
tule, or of any other FINRA rule constitutes a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

3 The sample data set was drawn from the time period January 2018 through June 2019.

2

By incorrectly marking short sale orders as long, Goldman violated Regulation SHO Rule
200(g) and FINRA Rule 2010.

By marking short sell orders as long, Goldman also violated FINRA rules relating to
filing accurate trade reports and maintaining accurate order memoranda.

FINRA Rule 6182 requires member firms to indicate on trade reports submitted to
FINRA whether a transaction in an NMS stock is a short sale or a short sale exempt
transaction. FINRA Rule 6624 contains the same requirement with respect to transactions
in OTC Equity Securities.

FINRA Rule 4511(a) provides that “[m]embers shall make and preserve books and
records as required under the FINRA rules, the Exchange Act and the applicable
Exchange Act rules.” Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3(a)(7)(i)
thereunder require broker-dealers to make and keep current memoranda for trade
executions that include the terms and conditions of the order. Implicit in these provisions
is the requirement that such memoranda be accurate.

Goldman mismarked and routed 59,981,252 short sale orders as long. Of those
59,981,252 orders, 7,866,996 were executed. The firm maintained inaccurate memoranda
for each of those sales. Also, 26,944,700 of the erroneously marked orders were routed to
an ATS for execution—resulting in the execution of 2,117,624 orders on an ATS in NMS
and OTC securities. The firm submitted inaccurate trade reports to FINRA with respect to
those 2,117,624 orders.

As a result, Goldman violated Exchange Act § 17(a) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-
3(a)(7)(i), and FINRA Rules 4511, 6182, 6624, and 2010.

Goldman failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to
comply with Rule 200(g) and FINRA rules relating to accurate trade reporting and
order memoranda.

FINRA Rule 3110(a) provides that “[e]ach member shall establish and maintain a system
to supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA
rules.”

Goldman failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to
achieve compliance with Rule 200(g) and rules relating to accurate trade reporting and
order memoranda. Although Goldman had a report that was designed to surveil for order
marking accuracy, that report reviewed the accuracy of the order marks of parent orders,
but did not confirm that the proper marking of the parent order carried over to the child
orders. This deficiency resulted in Goldman’s failure to detect that it had mismarked
approximately 60 million short sale orders as long during an approximately 29-month
period and the execution of 12,355 short sale transactions for 1,596,375 shares at or
below the national best bid while a short sale circuit breaker was in effect. It also resulted

in Goldman submitting over two million inaccurate trade reports to FINRA and creating
and maintaining over seven million inaccurate order memoranda.

In May 2019, Goldman enhanced its order marking surveillance report to capture child
orders as well as parent orders. In September 2019, the firm also added an additional
control designed to detect and prevent the routing of inaccurately marked short sale
orders (i.e., orders marked long that should be marked short).

By failing to have supervisory reviews reasonably designed to ensure the mismarked
orders were appropriately marked long or short consistent with Regulation SHO, order
marking, and books and records requirements, Goldman violated FINRA Rules 3110 and

2010.

RE: SpeedRoute LLC (Respondent)
Member Firm
CRD No. 104138

Pursuant to FINRA Rule 9216, Respondent SpeedRoute LLC submits this Letter of Acceptance,
Waiver, and Consent (AWC) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the alleged rule
violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if accepted, FINRA
will not bring any future actions against Respondent alleging violations based on the same
factual findings described in this AWC.

I.

ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

A. Respondent accepts and consents to the following findings by FINRA without admitting
or denying them:

BACKGROUND

SpeedRoute has been a FINRA member since August 2000. The firm provides market
access and routing/execution services to broker-dealer clients on an agency basis.
SpeedRoute does not engage in retail, institutional, or proprietary trading. The firm is
headquartered in Jersey City, NJ, and has twelve registered representatives. !

OVERVIEW

From September 2016 through February 2019, SpeedRoute accepted market orders for
the purchase of shares of new issues in the secondary market prior to the commencement
of trading of those shares in the secondary market. As a result, SpeedRoute violated
FINRA Rules 5131(d)(4) and 2010.

Additionally, from September 2016 through June 2019, SpeedRoute failed to establish
and maintain a supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, reasonably
designed to achieve compliance with FINRA Rule 5131(d)(4). As a result, SpeedRoute
violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.

' For more information about the firm, including prior regulatory events, visit BrokerCheck® at
www finra.org/brokercheck.

FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
This matter originated from FINRA’s examination of SpeedRoute.

SpeedRoute improperly accepted market orders for the purchases of shares of new
issues.

FINRA Rule 5131(d)(4) states: “[n]o member may accept a market order for the purchase
of shares of a new issue in the secondary market prior to the commencement of trading of
such shares in the secondary market.” A violation of FINRA Rule 5131(d)(4) also is a
violation of FINRA Rule 2010, which states that “[a] member, in the conduct of its
business, shall observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable
principles of trade.”

In 2010, in Regulatory Notice 10-60, FINRA reminded firms that FINRA Rule 5131 is
designed to enhance public confidence in the initial public offering process and protect
investors from the volatility and potential price fluctuations between the public offering
price of the new issue and price at which trading in the secondary market commences.

From September 2016 through February 2019, SpeedRoute accepted 128 market orders
to purchase shares in the secondary market of 49 new issues prior to the commencement
of trading of those shares in the secondary market. Therefore, SpeedRoute violated
FINRA Rules 5131(d)(4) and 2010.

SpeedRoute failed to establish, maintain and enforce a supervisory system, including
written supervisory procedures, reasonably designed to comply with its FINRA Rule
5131(d)(4) obligations.

FINRA Rule 3110(a) requires that FINRA members “establish and maintain a system to
supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA
rules.” FINRA Rule 3110(b) requires FINRA members to “establish, maintain, and
enforce written procedures to supervise the types of business in which it engages and the
activities of its associated persons that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules.”

From September 2016 to June 2019, SpeedRoute lacked a reasonable supervisory system,
including written supervisory procedures, pertaining to market orders in new issues. For
part of the period, the written procedures placed the responsibility of compliance on
SpeedRoute’s broker-dealer clients by stating that those customers should reject market
orders not in compliance with the rule. However, the written procedures failed to set forth
any process to surveil for instances in which SpeedRoute accepted a market order for the
purchase of shares of a new issue prior to secondary market trading.

In February 2019, SpeedRoute implemented a system to reject market orders in new
issues prior to trading in the secondary market and updated its written supervisory
procedures. In July 2019, SpeedRoute implemented an exception report designed to
detect instances in which it received and rejected a market order to purchase shares of a

ew)

new issue. In October 2021, SpeedRoute further enhanced its procedures by
implementing a monthly manual review to ensure that the firm’s automatic hard blocks
were working as expected.

By failing to have a reasonable supervisory system, including written supervisory
procedures reasonably designed to comply with its FINRA Rule 5131(d)(4) requirements,
SpeedRoute violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010.
B. Respondent also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:

1. A censure; and

2. A fine of $45,000.
Respondent agrees to pay the monetary sanction upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment is due and payable. Respondent has submitted an
Election of Payment form showing the method by which it proposes to pay the fine
imposed.
Respondent specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim an inability to pay, now
or at any time after the execution of this AWC, the monetary sanction imposed in this
matter.
The sanctions imposed in this AWC shall be effective on a date set by FINRA.

I.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose
of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as

Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-And-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:

Summary

1. These proceedings arise out of undisclosed fees that Merrill charged its advisory
clients for transfers of funds to or from their advisory accounts requiring foreign currency
exchanges (“Foreign Currency Exchanges”) from at least May 12, 2016 through June 29, 2020 (the
“Relevant Period”). Specifically, Merrill offered these clients wrap fee programs in which clients
paid Merrill a program fee based on a percentage of assets under management (the “wrap fee”) in
exchange for a range of investment advisory services, including foreign currency exchanges. As
part of the client agreements and accompanying brochures for these advisory programs
(collectively, the “Advisory Agreements”), Merrill disclosed additional fees and charges that were
not covered by the wrap fee.

2. As it related to the additional fees for Foreign Currency Exchanges, Merrill
materially misstated in the Advisory Agreements that it charged a markup or markdown on these
transactions while not also disclosing that it charged an additional fee referred to as a production
credit. For the vast majority, or over 80% of the relevant foreign currency transactions during the
Relevant Period, this production credit was equal to or greater than the markup or markdown.

3. During the Relevant Period, Merrill charged its advisory clients approximately
$4,134,610 in undisclosed production credits on over 15,000 separate Foreign Currency Exchanges
in approximately 4,874 advisory client accounts. Merrill paid a percentage of these production
credits to its financial advisors and, in fact, referred to this charge as a commission in internal
documents.

4. As a result of Merrill’s conduct, Merrill willfully! violated Sections 206(2) and
206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder.

' <Willfully,” for purposes of imposing relief under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and
Section 203(e) of the Advisers Act “‘means no more than that the person charged with the duty
knows what he is doing.’” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting
Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949)). There is no requirement that the actor
“also be aware that he is violating one of the Rules or Acts.” Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d
Cir. 1965).

Respondent

5. Merrill, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation, is a Delaware
company headquartered in New York, New York. Merrill has been registered with the Commission
as an investment adviser since 1978 and as a broker-dealer since 1959.

Background

6. During the Relevant Period, Merrill’s advisory clients that paid wrap fees (“wrap
fee clients”) could only hold currency in their advisory accounts in the form of U.S. dollars. As a
result, whenever wrap fee clients transferred foreign currency requiring an exchange into U.S.
dollars into their advisory accounts or transferred U.S. dollars from their advisory account
requiring an exchange into a foreign currency to an account that could hold foreign currency,
Merrill effected a foreign currency exchange, via its automated currency exchange platform.

7. Merrill’s investment advisory representatives or financial advisors (“FAs”)
facilitated these Foreign Currency Exchanges for wrap fee clients. Merrill’s FAs obtained a
currency exchange rate from either its Foreign Exchange Desk or from an internal platform.
Merrill calculated this rate to include two fees, a markup or markdown and a production credit.

8. For Foreign Currency Exchanges between Merrill accounts, Merrill charged wrap
fee clients a maximum fee of 2% of the gross amount of currency exchanged or converted,
inclusive of both fees. For Foreign Currency Exchanges from a Merrill account to an external
(non-Merrill) account, Merrill charged wrap fee clients a maximum of 1.5% of the gross amount of
currency exchanged or converted, inclusive of both fees. In both cases, Merrill had the discretion
to waive either the markup or markdown, or production credits charged on Foreign Currency
Exchanges.

9. Merrill’s internal records list the markup or markdown and the production credit for
each transaction as separate fees. Furthermore, Merrill’s internal processing documents for
Foreign Currency Exchanges addressed each fee separately and referred to the production credit as
a commission.

Merrill’s Disclosures

10. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreements, advisory clients paid a single “wrap fee” to
cover a range of transactions and services for which Merrill would otherwise charge separate fees.
This wrap fee represents an annualized rate applied to assets under management and charged on a
monthly basis. The Advisory Agreements also set forth certain additional fees not covered by the
wrap fee.

11. During the Relevant Period, Merrill materially misstated in the Advisory
Agreements that it would charge a markup or markdown on Foreign Currency Exchanges, while
not also disclosing that it would charge a separate production credit, let alone that the production
credit would be equal to or greater than any markups or markdowns charged to a client.

3

12. After Merrill processed a Foreign Currency Exchange for a wrap fee client, it
provided the client with a trade confirmation that did not identify the fees charged as part of the
transaction. Instead, the confirmation incorporated the markup or markdown and production credit
as part of the foreign exchange price that the client received. During the Relevant Period, Merrill
did not specifically disclose how much it charged clients for Foreign Currency Exchanges, either
on a percentage basis or otherwise.

13. During the Relevant Period, Merrill charged a production credit on over 80% of the
15,916 Foreign Currency Exchanges that Merrill processed on behalf of wrap fee clients.

14. Moreover, in 95% of the Foreign Currency Exchanges that Merrill processed during
the Relevant Period, and for which production credits were charged, the undisclosed production
credits were either equal to or greater than the disclosed markups or markdowns.

15. For example, on January 23, 2020, Merrill processed an outgoing international wire
transfer of $19,342,946.07 involving an exchange from U.S. dollars to British pounds. For this
exchange, Merrill charged the wrap fee client a total fee of $105,798.45, consisting of a markup of
$9,524.79 and a production credit of $96,273.66.

16. In another example, on September 8, 2017, Merrill processed a transfer into a
Merrill wrap fee account in the amount of $148,694.26 involving an exchange from British pounds
into U.S. dollars. For this exchange, Merrill charged the wrap fee client a total fee of $1,502.77,
consisting of a markup of $375.69 and a production credit of $1,127.08.

17. In total, Merrill charged its wrap fee clients $4,134,610 in undisclosed production
credits during the Relevant Period.

Merrill Updates Its Disclosures

18. On June 30, 2020, pursuant to the Commission’s newly implemented rules relating
to registered investment advisers, Merrill provided new and existing clients with a copy of its Form
CRS, which outlined various fees related to investment advisory accounts and provided links to
new fee disclosure documents, including a document entitled Explanation of Fees. The
Explanation of Fees document, for the first time, disclosed to wrap fee clients the maximum
percentage amount that wrap fee clients could be charged for Foreign Currency Exchanges,
inclusive of both Merrill’s markup or markdown as well as the production credits that Merrill had
been charging its wrap fee clients for these transactions. In March 2022, Merrill further enhanced
its wrap fee program disclosure documents, disclosing specifically that the wrap program fee does
not cover Foreign Currency Exchanges and providing a link to the Explanation of Fees document
for a detailed description of the fees.

Policies and Procedures

19. Merrill failed to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act in connection with currency transfers
requiring foreign currency exchanges that it processed for its wrap fee clients. In particular,
Merrill failed to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to monitor and disseminate
complete and accurate information related to currency transfers requiring foreign currency
exchanges to ensure that its marketing and client communications relating to its wrap fee
program were not misleading.

Violations

20. As a result of the conduct described above, Merrill willfully violated Section
206(2) of the Advisers Act, which prohibits an investment adviser from engaging in any
transaction, practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon a client or
prospective client.

21. As a result of the conduct described above, Merrill willfully violated Section 206(4)
of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, which require, among other things, that a
registered investment adviser adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act and the rules thereunder by the adviser.

Disgorgement

22. The disgorgement and prejudgment interest ordered in paragraph IV.C is
consistent with equitable principles and does not exceed Respondent’s net profits from its
violations, and will be distributed to harmed investors to the extent feasible pursuant to the
respondent-administered distribution described in paragraph IV.C below. Upon approval of the
distribution final accounting by the Commission, any amounts remaining that are infeasible to
return to investors, and any amounts returned to the Commission in the future that are infeasible
to return to investors, may be transferred to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, subject to
Section 21F(g)(3) of the Exchange Act.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent Merrill’s Offer.

Accordingly, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and Sections 203(e) and
203(k) of the Advisers Act it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Merrill cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future
violations of Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder.

B. Merrill is censured.

C. Merrill shall pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, totaling
$9,694,714, as follows:

1.

Respondent shall pay disgorgement of $4,134,610, prejudgment interest of
$760,104, and a civil penalty of $4,800,000, consistent with the provisions of
this Subsection C.

Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a Fair Fund is
created for the disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties referenced
in Subsection C(1) above. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money
penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the
government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the
deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related
Investor Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by,
offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of
any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil penalty in this action (“Penalty
Offset”). Ifthe court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty
Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final
order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this
action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional
civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil
penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a
“Related Investor Action” means a private damages action brought against
Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially
the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.

Within ten (10) days of the issuance of this Order, Respondent shall deposit
the full amount of the disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalty
(the “Fair Fund”), into an escrow account at a financial institution not
unacceptable to the Commission staff and Respondent shall provide the
Commission staff with evidence of such deposit in a form acceptable to the
Commission staff. The account holding the assets of the Fair Fund shall bear
the name and the taxpayer identification number of the Fair Fund. If timely
payment into the escrow account is not made, additional interest shall accrue
pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 [17 C.F.R. § 201.600] and/or 31
U.S.C. § 3717.

Respondent shall be responsible for administering the Fair Fund and may
hire a professional to assist it in the administration of the distribution. The
costs and expenses of administering the Fair Fund, including any such

professional services, shall be borne by Respondent and shall not be paid
out of the Fair Fund.

Respondent shall distribute from the Fair Fund to current and former clients
an amount representing the financial harm incurred, with reasonable
interest, resulting from the false or misleading statements referenced in the
Order. The disbursement calculation (the “Calculation”’) will be submitted
to, reviewed, and approved by the Commission staff in accordance with
Paragraph (6) of this Subsection C. No portion of the Fair Fund shall be
paid to any affected current or former client account in which Respondent,
or any of its current or former officers or directors, has a financial interest.

Respondent shall, within ninety (90) days of the entry of this Order, submit
a Calculation to the Commission staff for review and approval. At or
around the time of submission of the proposed Calculation to the staff,
Respondent shall make itself available, and shall require any third parties or
professionals retained by Respondent to assist in formulating the
methodology for its Calculation and/or administration of the distribution to
be available for a conference call with the Commission staff to explain the
methodology used in preparing the proposed Calculation and its
implementation, and to provide the staff with an opportunity to ask
questions. Respondent also shall provide the Commission staff such
additional information and supporting documentation as the Commission
staff may request for the purpose of its review. In the event of one or more
objections by the Commission staff to Respondent’s proposed Calculation
or any of its information or supporting documentation, Respondent shall
submit a revised Calculation for the review and approval of Commission
staff or additional information or supporting documentation within twenty
(20) days of the date that the Commission staff notifies Respondent of the
objection. The revised Calculation shall be subject to all of the provisions
of this Subsection C.

Respondent shall, within thirty (30) days of the written approval of the
Calculation by the Commission staff, submit a payment file (the “Payment
File”) for review and acceptance by the Commission staff demonstrating the
application of the methodology to each affected client and former client.
The Payment File should identify, at a minimum: (a) the name of each
affected client and former client; (b) the exact amount of the payment to be
made; and (c) the amount of reasonable interest paid. The Respondent shall
exclude from the Payment File all payments to payees that appear on the
US. Treasury Department Specially Designated Nationals List.

Respondent shall disburse all amounts payable to affected clients and former
clients within seventy-five (75) days of the date the Commission staff

7

10.

accepts the Payment File unless such time period is extended as provided in
Paragraph (12) of this Subsection C. Respondent shall notify the
Commission staff of the date and the amount paid in the final distribution.

If Respondent is unable to distribute or return any portion of the Fair Fund
for any reason, including an inability to locate an affected client or former
client or a beneficial owner of an affected client or former client or any
factors beyond Respondent’s control, Respondent shall transfer any such
undistributed funds to the Commission for transmittal to the United States
Treasury in accordance with Section 21F(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 once the distribution of funds is complete and before the final
accounting provided for in Paragraph (11) of this Subsection C is submitted
to the Commission staff. Payment must be made in one of the following
ways:

a. Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission,
which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon
request;

b. Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via

Pay.gov through the SEC website at
http://www.sec. gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

Cc Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or
United States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center

Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Respondent may retain any
professional services necessary. The costs and expenses of tax compliance,
including any such professional services, shall be borne by Respondent and
shall not be paid out of the Fair Fund.

Within 30 days after Respondent completes the disbursement of all amounts
payable to affected investors, Respondent shall return all undisbursed funds
to the Commission pursuant to the instruction set forth in this Subsection C.
Respondent shall then submit to the Commission staff a final accounting and

the Calculation approved by the Commission staff. The final accounting and
certification, together with proof and supporting documentation of such
payment in a form acceptable to the Commission staff, shall be sent to
Thomas P. Smith, Associate Regional Director, New York Regional Office,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 Pearl Street, Suite 20-100, New
York, New York 10004-2616, or such other address as the Commission staff
may provide. Respondent shall provide any and all supporting
documentation for the accounting and certification to the Commission staff
upon its request, and shall cooperate with any additional requests by the
Commission staff in connection with the accounting and certification.

12. The Commission staff may extend any of the procedural dates set forth in
this Subsection C for good cause shown. Deadlines for dates relating to the
Fair Fund shall be counted in calendar days, except if the last day falls on a
weekend or federal holiday, the next business day shall be considered the last

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the

instituted pursuant to Sections 203(e), 203(f), and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these

Act of 1940, and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds! that:

Summary

1. This matter arises from Chatham’s and Melchiorre’s trading, on behalf of their fund
clients, in three high-yield debt securities issued by American Media Inc. (“AMI”), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AMI Parent Holdings, LLC (“AMI Parent’). At times, from 2016 through 2018,
Chatham and Melchiorre engaged in transactions in these AMI debt securities (the “AMI Bonds”)
that resulted in one Chatham fund selling AMI Bonds and a different Chatham fund purchasing the
same AMI Bonds, through various broker-dealers (the “Rebalancing Trades”). Chatham engaged in
the Rebalancing Trades to address portfolio constraints such as industry or issuer fund concentration
limits, to meet investor redemptions, and to allocate capital inflows and outflows. These trades
were executed at prices Chatham and Melchiorre proposed. Over time, the prices at which Chatham
and Melchiorre traded the securities in the Rebalancing Trades increased at a significantly higher
rate than the prices of similar securities. Chatham’s and Melchiorre’s trading in the AMI Bonds
accounted for the vast majority of the trading in those Bonds and therefore over time had a material
effect on their pricing.

2. Chatham and Melchiorre calculated the net asset values (“NAVs”) of their client
funds’ holdings using pricing data that was based, in part, on the trading prices of the securities. As
a result, during the relevant time period, the NAVs of Chatham’s Clients were higher than they
would have been if Chatham’s Rebalancing Trades were removed from the market for the AMI
Bonds, which, in turn, resulted in higher fees being charged to the clients than would have been
charged if Chatham’s Rebalancing Trades were removed from the market.

3h Many of the Rebalancing Trades involved open-ended mutual funds regulated as
registered investment companies (““RICs”). In those cases, Chatham and Melchiorre aided and
abetted and caused RICs to enter into prohibited affiliate transactions in violation of Sections
17(a)(1) and (2) of the Investment Company Act.

Respondents

4. Chatham Asset Management LLC (“Chatham”) is a Delaware limited liability
company based in Chatham, New Jersey. It has been registered with the Commission as an
investment adviser since 2012 (CRD No. 157517; SEC No. 801-73452). From approximately
January 2016 to December 2018 (the “Relevant Period”), Chatham advised and managed a number

d The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers and are not binding on any other person or

entity in this or any other proceeding.

of hedge funds, including the following: the Chatham Asset High Yield Master Fund, Ltd.; the
Chatham Asset Private Debt and Strategic Capital Fund, LP; the Chatham Fund, LP; the Chatham
Everest Fund, L.P.; and the Chatham Eureka Fund, LP (collectively the “Funds’’). The Funds are
organized as domestic and offshore partnerships. During the Relevant Period, Chatham also
served as the adviser or sub-adviser to a number of liquid alternative funds? (“LAFs” together with
the Funds, the “Clients’”’), some of which LAFs were RICs. Per its Form ADV filed in March
2022, Chatham managed approximately $8.6 billion on a discretionary basis across its Clients.

5. Anthony Melchiorre, age 55, resides in Short Hills, New Jersey. He is the founder
and principal owner of Chatham. During the Relevant Period, Melchiorre owned approximately
70 percent of Chatham, and is the managing member of the general partner entity for each of the
Funds. During the Relevant Period, Melchiorre also served as the primary portfolio manager for
all of Chatham’s Clients.

Other Relevant Entity

6. AML now known as a360 Media LLC, is a print media publisher that, during the
Relevant Period, was responsible for numerous long-running publications, including US Weekly
and The National Enquirer. Chatham acquired 78 percent of AMI Parent’s equity for certain of the
Funds in 2014. Through the Funds’ ownership of AMI Parent, Chatham and Melchiorre
effectively controlled AMI and appointed two Chatham employees to AMI’s four-person board.

Background

Te During the Relevant Period, Chatham and Melchiorre were investment advisers to
all of their Clients. They implemented a similar strategy for each Client—investing in high yield
bonds, leveraged loans, and credit derivatives.

8. In implementing this strategy, Chatham caused the Clients to take a number of
concentrated “high conviction” positions in debt securities issued by companies in the print media
industry, including AMI. A “high conviction” position was a position that Chatham had a high
degree of confidence would produce satisfactory investment returns over time.

9. Pursuant to the high conviction strategy, during the Relevant Period, Chatham and
Melchiorre caused their Clients to acquire substantial positions in the AMI Bonds. The percentage
of the Clients’ portfolios invested in AMI Bonds varied for each Client, but on average the AMI
Bonds constituted 11 percent of Client portfolios. During the Relevant Period, the Clients
collectively owned an average of 83 percent of the bonds issued by AMI.

2 Liquid alternative funds are mutual funds that seek to implement hedge fund-like strategies while

maintaining daily liquidity. After the Relevant Period, Chatham wound down its relationship with its Clients who
were RICs, and has not advised any Clients that are RICs as of December 2020.

10. Through its control of the Funds, Chatham also possessed voting control of AMI
during the Relevant Period. On average during the Relevant Period, the Funds owned an average
of 80 percent of the equity in AMI Parent, the sole shareholder of AMI?

11. The AMI Bonds generally were illiquid investments and traded over the counter.
There were few purchasers of the AMI Bonds other than the Chatham Clients. Indeed, when the
next largest holder of AMI Bonds attempted to sell them on the open market during the Relevant
Period, they were unable to find any purchaser aside from Chatham Clients.

12. Melchiorre understood that liquidity was limited for the AMI Bonds.

13. From time to time, notwithstanding Chatham’s favorable view of the investment, it
would become necessary for the Clients to sell portfolio positions, including AMI Bonds, due to
the parameters of a Chatham Client account.

14. Specifically, the LAFs, including those that were RICs, imposed limits on the
percentage of funds that could be invested in a single issuer or industry. In addition, the LAFs,
including those that were RICs, provided daily liquidity to their shareholders, meaning that
investors could withdraw their money at any time.

15. Due to the position limits and daily liquidity needs of the LAFs, and the high
concentration of AMI Bonds held by the LAFs, Chatham and Melchiorre frequently were required
to “rebalance” the LAF portfolios by selling certain of the AMI Bonds.

16. In other cases, the Clients had a need to sell the AMI Bonds in order to fund
investor redemptions or other cash needs.

17. Generally, when Chatham was forced to sell a high conviction AMI Bond in these
circumstances, Chatham desired to purchase the AMI Bond for another Client because Chatham
still believed in the merits of the investment and would not otherwise be selling the AMI Bonds if
it were not for the portfolio restrictions or cash needs of the selling Clients.

18. Recognizing that there were legal restrictions on trading between RICs and their
affiliates, which included other Chatham Clients, Chatham and Melchiorre sought advice from a
compliance consultant on how to facilitate the Rebalancing Trades. The consultant advised
Chatham to conduct the trading either through a single broker over more than one day or through
multiple brokers if on the same day. The foundational principle underlying the advice was to
ensure that the transactions occurred at independently-derived market prices.

19. As portfolio manager for the Chatham Clients, Melchiorre personally caused the
Rebalancing Trades in AMI Bonds to be executed. Each Rebalancing Trade involved the sale of
AMI Bonds by one or more Clients and an offsetting purchase or purchases of the AMI Bonds by
one or more different Clients.

2 The equity positions in AMI Parent were only held by the Funds, not the RICs.

4

20. To execute the Rebalancing Trades, Melchiorre worked with a small number of
broker-dealer firms with whom he had traded previously (the “Rebalancing Brokers’’).

21. Consistent with the compliance consultant’s advice, Melchiorre generally executed
the Rebalancing Trades through a single Rebalancing Broker’s firm over more than one day or
through multiple Rebalancing Broker firms during a single day, and he also sometimes executed
them through multiple broker firms over multiple days.

22. The Rebalancing Trades, however, were executed at prices proposed by Melchiorre
and agreed to by the Rebalancing Brokers, but not at prices that were independently derived from
price discovery in the broader market.

23. Around the time that Chatham began to execute the Rebalancing Trades,
Melchiorre generally explained the purpose of the Rebalancing Trades to the Rebalancing Brokers.
Melchiorre informed each of the Rebalancing Brokers to whom he sold a Client’s AMI Bonds that
he likely would have an interest in repurchasing that same AMI Bond he was selling for another
Client. Over time, an understanding developed on the part of the Rebalancing Brokers that
whenever Melchiorre placed an order to sell one of the AMI Bonds for a Client, he would
repurchase it for another Client, either directly the following day or days, or indirectly through
another broker.

24. The Rebalancing Brokers engaged in the Rebalancing Trades because they
expected Melchiorre to repurchase the bonds. The business model of several of the Rebalancing
Brokers was to “match” buy and sell orders from their customers. Those Rebalancing Brokers
ordinarily did not purchase securities for their own inventory—i.e., put the firm’s own capital at
risk—or they did so on a very limited basis. Nonetheless, the vast majority of the Rebalancing
Trades involved at least one Rebalancing Broker that purchased bonds into its firm’s inventory.
For example, some of the Rebalancing Brokers would at times agree to purchase securities from
Chatham even though the Rebalancing Broker may not have lined up the other leg of the
transaction. These brokers’ willingness to do so was based on their expectation that Chatham
would repurchase the bonds, either directly or through another broker.

25. The purchasing Rebalancing Brokers generally did not offer the AMI Bonds to
other customers in the market. Instead, in virtually every case, they resold the securities to
Chatham or to another broker who they understood was purchasing for Chatham.

26. As Chatham’s need to conduct rebalancing in its various Client Accounts increased
over time, Rebalancing Trades became routine. When Melchiorre wanted to sell an AMI Bond to
one particular Rebalancing Broker (“Rebalancing Broker A”) and then repurchase it the following
day, he would send Rebalancing Broker A a message indicating that he wanted to sell an AMI
Bond in the “usual drill.” Rebalancing Broker A then would purchase the AMI Bond into the
firm’s inventory until Melchiorre repurchased it the following day.

27. Other Rebalancing Brokers understood that when Melchiorre sold them an AMI
Bond, they should look for a corresponding purchase from a second Rebalancing Broker, identified
by Melchiorre, who also was representing Chatham.

5

28. The Rebalancing Brokers stood to benefit from the Rebalancing Trades because
they expected Chatham to repurchase the bonds at a higher price, and it typically did so.

29. Melchiorre proposed the price for the Rebalancing Trades and the Rebalancing
Brokers agreed to it without first soliciting bids from other market participants.

30. When proposing a price for Rebalancing Trades, Melchiorre considered a number
of factors, which included the prior day’s price as reflected in prices published by a pricing service.
Those published prices would have been influenced, to some extent, by Chatham’s own trading.
When purchasing the AMI Bonds, Melchiorre also added a spread to compensate the Rebalancing
Brokers. For example, in the case of a Rebalancing Trade executed through a single Rebalancing
Broker overnight, Chatham would repurchase the AMI Bonds for a small spread above what it had
sold the AMI Bonds to the broker the day before. In the case of a multi-broker Rebalancing Trade,
Melchiorre would bid a small spread above the prior sale that was sufficient to compensate each of
the Rebalancing Brokers involved.

31. Over the Relevant Period, Chatham and Melchiorre engaged in over one hundred
Rebalancing Trades in AMI Bonds, accounting for approximately 81 percent, on average, of the
customer trading (i.e., not broker-to-broker trading) in such securities.

32s Over time, the frequent Rebalancing Trades and repeated mark-ups to compensate
the Rebalancing Brokers resulted in the market price of AMI Bonds increasing at a faster rate than
prices of similar securities. For example, by November 2017, two of the AMI Bonds traded in
Rebalancing Trades at implied yields lower than the prevailing London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”). Such yields ordinarily would have been associated with a bond of a much higher
creditworthiness than the AMI Bonds.

33. Chatham was compensated for its advisory services to the Funds with a
management fee and a performance fee, and to the LAFs with a management fee. The
management fee charged to certain Clients was set at a percentage of the NAV of those Clients.

34. In order to calculate each Fund’s NAV, Chatham used an independent pricing
service to determine the value of each of the portfolio securities, including the AMI Bonds. The
LAF administrators calculated their own NAVs, also using the same pricing service Chatham used.

35. Chatham and Melchiorre understood that the pricing service that Chatham and the
LAF administrators utilized was based to some extent on recent trading prices and that the
Rebalancing Trades accounted for virtually all of the trading in the Bonds during the Relevant
Period. Because the Rebalancing Trades at times increased the prices of the AMI Bonds, the
NAVs of the Client accounts also were increased by that amount on those occasions.

36. Accordingly, the Clients paid Chatham an estimated $11,000,000 in performance
and/or management fees that they would not have in the absence of Chatham’s Rebalancing
Trades. Chatham in turn paid approximately 55 percent of such fees to Melchiorre.

37. As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents willfully violated Section
206(2) of the Advisers Act, which prohibits an investment adviser from engaging in any
transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or
prospective client. Scienter is not required to establish a violation of Section 206(2), but rather such
a violation may rest on a finding of negligence. SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 643 n.5 (D.C. Cir.
1992) (citing SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 195 (1963)).

38. As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents willfully aided and abetted
violations of, and caused certain Clients to violate, Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the
Investment Company Act, which make it unlawful for any affiliated person or promoter of or
principal underwriter for a RIC or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal
underwriter, acting as principal (1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such RIC
or to any company controlled by such RIC, or (2) knowingly to purchase from such RIC, or from
any company controlled by such RIC, any security or other property, unless the transaction
complies with the exemptive requirements of Rule 17a-7 under the Investment Company Act, or
the adviser obtains an exemptive order under Section 17(b) of the Investment Company Act.

Disgorgement

39. The disgorgement and prejudgment interest ordered in paragraph IV(G) below is
consistent with equitable principles and does not exceed Respondents’ net profits from their
violations, and will be distributed to harmed investors to the extent feasible. The Commission will
hold funds paid pursuant to paragraph IV(G) in an account at the United States Treasury pending
distribution. Upon approval of the distribution final accounting by the Commission, any amounts
remaining that are infeasible to return to investors, and any amounts returned to the Commission in
the future that are infeasible to return to investors, may be transferred to the general fund of the
United States Treasury, subject to Section 21 F(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Undertaking

Respondents Chatham and Melchiorre agree to undertake to assist the Commission staff in
the administration of a distribution plan, including any and all efforts to distribute to affected
investors the monetary relief described in paragraph IV(G) below. In connection with such
assistance, Respondents will produce, without service or notice of subpoena, information
reasonably requested by the Commission staff.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondents’ Offers.

Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 203(e), 203(f) and 203(k) of the Advisers Act, and

and any future violations of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act or Section 17(a) of the Investment
Company Act.

B. Respondents are censured.

& Respondent Chatham cease and desist from committing or causing any violations
and any future violations of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act or Section 17(a) of the Investment

advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
investment company or affiliated person of such investment adviser, depositor, or principal
underwriter.

E. Pursuant to Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act, Respondent Chatham be,
and hereby is, prohibited from serving or acting as an employee, officer, director, member of an
advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
investment company or affiliated person of such investment adviser, depositor, or principal
underwriter.

F, Any reapplication for association by Respondents will be subject to the applicable
laws and regulations governing the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned upon a number
of factors, including, but not limited to, compliance with the Commission’s Order and payment of
any or all of the following: (a) any disgorgement or civil penalties ordered by a Court against the
Respondents in any action brought by the Commission; (b) any disgorgement amounts ordered
against the Respondents for which the Commission waived payment; (c) any arbitration award
related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission Order; (d) any self-regulatory
organization arbitration award to a customer, whether or not related to the conduct that served as the
basis for the Commission Order; and (e) any restitution order by a self-regulatory organization,
whether or not related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission Order.

G. Respondents shall pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $11,000,000 and
prejudgment interest of $3,375,072. In addition, Respondent Melchiorre shall pay a civil penalty
of $600,000, and Respondent Chatham shall pay a civil penalty of $4,400,000 to the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Payment shall be made in the following installments:

Practice 600 and pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3717. Prior to making the final payment set forth herein,

Respondents shall contact the staff of the Commission for the amount due. If Respondents fail to
8

make any payment by the date agreed and/or in the amount agreed according to the schedule set
forth above, all outstanding payments under this Order, including post-order interest, minus any
payments made, shall become due and payable immediately at the discretion of the staff of the

Fund is created for the disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalty payments referenced in
paragraph IV(G) above. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this
Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax

Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by,
offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of
Respondents’ payments of a civil penalties in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any
Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30
days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in
this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change
the amount of the civil penalties imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a
“Related Investor Action” means a private damages action brought against Respondents by or on
behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order
entered by the Commission in this proceeding.

I. Respondents Chatham and Melchiorre shall comply with the undertaking
enumerated in Section III above.

V.

It is further ORDERED that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in
Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523, the findings in this Order are true and
admitted by Respondent Melchiorre, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest,
civil penalty or other amounts due by Respondent Melchiorre under this Order or any other
judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this
proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Respondent of the federal securities laws or any
regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(19).

By the Commission.

","The text is an SEC order against investment adviser Chatham Asset Management and its principal Anthony Melchiorre for improper trading of bonds issued by American Media Inc. (AMI) from 2016-2018. Chatham engaged in trades between its client funds to rebalance concentrations in the illiquid AMI bonds, executing the trades through brokers at increasingly higher prices proposed by Chatham. This trading accounted for most of the volume in the bonds. As a result, Chatham's client funds paid inflated management fees based on inflated net asset values. Chatham and Melchiorre were found to have violated their fiduciary duties and caused violations of the Investment Company Act prohibition on affiliate transactions. To settle, they agreed to pay over $14 million in disgorgement, interest, and penalties, and accepted bans from the investment company industry."

* * *

Pursuant to Rule 9216 of the NYSE American LLC (“NYSE American” or the “Exchange”)
Code of Procedure, J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC (“JPM” or the “Firm”) submits this Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (“AWC”) for the purpose of proposing a settlement of the
alleged rule violations described below. This AWC is submitted on the condition that, if
accepted, NYSE American will not bring any future actions against the Firm alleging violations
based on the same factual findings described herein.

I. ACCEPTANCE AND CONSENT

A. JPM hereby accepts and consents, without admitting or denying the findings, and solely
for the purposes of this proceeding and any other proceeding brought by or on behalf of
NYSE American, or to which NYSE American is a party, prior to a hearing and without
an adjudication of any issue of law or fact, to the entry of the following findings by
NYSE American:

BACKGROUND AND JURISDICTION

1, JPM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., is a Delaware limited
liability company, headquartered in New York, New York. JPM has been registered
as an AmEx Trading Permit (“ATP”) Holder with NYSE American since 1988.
Among other services, JPM acts an agency broker-dealer and options market maker.

1 Those matters were brought by NYSE Arca LLC and Nasdaq ISE, LLC.

VIOLATIONS
Violations of NYSE American Rule 995NY(c) (Anticipatory Hedging)
2, NYSE American Rule 995NY(c) provides the following:

It will be considered conduct inconsistent with just and equitable
principles of trade for any ATP Holder or person associated with an
ATP Holder, who has knowledge of all material terms and conditions
of an originating order, a solicited order, or a facilitation order, the
execution of which are imminent, to enter, based on such knowledge,
an order to buy or sell an option on the underlying securities of any
option that is the subject of the order, or an order to buy or sell the
security underlying any option that is the subject of the order, or any
order to buy or sell any related instrument until either: (1) All the
terms and conditions of the originating order and any changes in the
terms or conditions of the order of which the ATP Holder or person
associated with the ATP Holder has knowledge are disclosed to the
trading crowd, or (2) The trade can no longer reasonably be considered
imminent in view of the passage of time since the order was received.

3. When an ATP Holder engages in improper anticipatory hedging or otherwise uses
undisclosed information about an imminent option transaction to trade the relevant
option(s) or a related instrument (including the underlying security on which the
options are based), it can potentially alter the market for either or both the subject
option(s) or the underlying security.

4. Asaresult, the party submitting the options order could receive an inferior price and
other market participants could be disadvantaged by changing their trading activity
based on the price movement arising from the improper hedging activity. Therefore,
as set forth in NYSE American Rule 995NY(c), such conduct is considered
inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.

5. In addition, NYSE American Regulatory Bulletin RBO-AMEX 14-01 (“Anticipatory
Hedging and Frontrunning of Floor Orders,” dated February 14, 2014), states that:

ATP Holders that send orders to the Floor for execution should
have procedures whereby they can reasonably assure themselves
that that [sic] an order has been systematized? and represented
before they enter another order in the same or a related instrument
for hedging or other purposes, based on the knowledge of the yet
to be represented order. ATP Holders are cautioned that simply
relying upon the passage of time from when an order is transmitted
to the Floor, to make an assumption that the order has actually

? Systematization refers to an options Floor broker’s entry of an order into an electronic format,

2

been represented in the trading crowd, would not be considered an
acceptable procedure.

6. Thus, as RBO-AMEX 14-01 states:

An ATP Holder may be deemed to have violated NYSE American
Rule 995SNY(c) if the ATP Holder, having knowledge of all
material terms and conditions of an order, the execution of which
is imminent, enters an order to buy or sell an option on a security
underlying any option that is the subject of the order, or an order to
buy or sell the security underlying any option that is the subject of
the order, or any order to buy or sell any related instrument, prior
to the systemization and representation of such order.

August 2, 2019 Trading Activity

7. On August 2, 2019, a JPM trader (“JPM Trader A”), having knowledge of the
material terms and conditions of a customer options order, instructed another JEM
trader on a different desk (“JPM Trader B”) to effect hedging transactions in the
underlying security prior to the terms and conditions of the customer options order
being disclosed.

8. Specifically, on August 2, 2019, JPM Trader A received a customer order to sell and
buy spread contracts in Symbol 1. JPM Trader A agreed to facilitate the trade.

9. At approximately 11:10:17 a.m., JPM Trader A entered the entire customer options
order (27,450 spread contracts) for electronic execution on Nasdaq ISE. JPM Trader
A received a reject message cancelling the order almost instantaneously from Nasdaq
ISE. Nonetheless, at 11:10:21 a.m., JPM Trader A instructed JPM Trader B to enter
JPM’s hedging equity order to buy the underlying security. As a result, at 11:10:21
a.m., JPM Trader B entered and executed an order to buy 83,280 shares of Symbol 1
to partially hedge JPM’s facilitation of the customer options order.

10, At 11:10:33 a.m., after JPM’s hedging order had been executed, JPM Trader A routed
and executed an electronic facilitation for part of the customer options order (14,000
spread contracts) on Nasdaq ISE. At 11:10:51 a.m., JPM Trader A instructed an
unaffiliated NYSE American options floor broker to cross the balance of the customer
options order (13,450 spread contracts) on the NYSE American trading floor. The
order was systematized at 11:11:39 a.m. and executed at 11:11:51 a.m., with JPM
facilitating 12,000 spread contracts.

11. By entering a hedging order to buy the underlying security before the terms and
conditions of the customer options order had been disclosed to the market, JPM

3 JPM, as facilitating contra party, needed to buy approximately 582,000 shares of the underlying security in order to
fully hedge the customer options order, the balance of which came from the desk’s existing inventory.

12.

13.

14.

15.

16.

violated NYSE American Rule 995NY(c).

October 11, 2022 Trading Activity

On October 11, 2022, a JPM trader, having knowledge of the material terms and
conditions of a customer options order, effected hedging transactions in the
underlying security prior to the terms and conditions of the customer options order
being disclosed.

Specifically, on October 11, 2022, at 10:12:42 a.m., an interdealer broker messaged
two JPM traders (“JPM Trader C” and “JPM Trader D”) with an order to buy 5,000
put contracts in Symbol 2 on behalf of a customer. At 10:15:52 a.m., JPM Trader C
offered to sell all 5,000 contracts at a specified price. At 10:17:04 a.m., the
interdealer broker agreed to the price, “subj[ect] to cross.” Two seconds later, at
10:17:06 a.m., JPM Trader C asked whether the option trade was, “All me right?” to
which the interdealer broker replied “Yes” at 10:17:12 a.m,

Based on the above communications, JPM Trader D incorrectly understood that JEM
was the only participant on this trade and that the facilitation order had been disclosed
to the NYSE American trading crowd. As a result, at 10:17:58 a.m., JPM Trader D
entered and executed JPM’s hedging equity order to sell approximately 30,000 shares
of the underlying security. At 10:19:30 a.m., JPM Trader D realized that the
facilitation order in fact had not been represented in the trading crowd, after JPM’s
hedging order already had been entered and executed.

By entering a hedging order to sell the underlying security before the terms and
conditions of the customer options order had been represented on the NYSE
American trading floor, JPM violated NYSE American Rule 995NY(c).

JPM self-identified and self-reported this trading activity to Enforcement in the
course of this investigation.

Violations of NYSE American Rule 320(e) (Supervision)

17.

18.

NYSE American Rule 320(e) requires that a firm must “establish, maintain, enforce
and keep current a system of compliance and supervisory controls, reasonably
designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations and
Exchange rules.”

Although JPM had daily monitoring in place to flag potential Anticipatory Hedging
or front running of customer orders, the Firm did not conduct reviews of transactions
across different aggregation units, and thus did not identify certain potential
Anticipatory Hedging activity, including the violative trading activity on August 2,
2019. In addition, due to a coding issue, the Firm’s monitoring logic failed to identify
potential Anticipatory Hedging activity in connection with facilitation trades for
multi-leg customer options orders for approximately two years. As a result, although
the Firm maintained a supervisory system to identify potential Anticipatory Hedging

4

activity, the Firm’s supervisory system was not reasonably designed to ensure
compliance with NYSE American Rule 995NY(c) because of the above issues. JPM
remediated both issues in July 2022.

19. Accordingly, JPM violated NYSE American Rule 320(e).

RELEVANT PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY

20. On November 8, 2017, JPM settled with NYSE Arca for $25,000 for one instance of
Anticipatory Hedging in violation of NYSE Arca Rule 6.49-O(b). See NYSE Arca
Matter No. 2017-03-00042.

SANCTIONS
B. The Firm also consents to the imposition of the following sanctions:

Censure and fine in the amount of $65,000 (resolved simultaneously with
similar matters for a total fine of $230,000)!

The Firm agrees to pay the monetary sanction(s) upon notice that this AWC has been
accepted and that such payment(s) are due and payable. The Firm has submitted a
Method of Payment Confirmation form showing the method by which it will pay the fine
imposed,

The Firm specifically and voluntarily waives any right to claim that it is unable to pay,
now or at any time hereafter, the monetary sanction(s) imposed in this matter.

The sanctions imposed herein shall be effective on a date set by NYSE Regulation staff.
II. WAIVER OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS

The Firm specifically and voluntarily waives the following rights granted under the NYSE
American Code of Procedure:

A. To have a Formal Complaint issued specifying the allegations against the Firm;

B. To be notified of the Formal Complaint and have the opportunity to answer the
allegations in writing;
