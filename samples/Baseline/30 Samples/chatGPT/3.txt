Fortune Financial Services, Inc. ("Fortune") faced scrutiny for its inadequate supervision of variable annuity exchange recommendations. Notably, the firm's oversight failed to detect misrepresentations on 136 exchange applications by Representative A, who had understated or omitted actual customer surrender charges. Furthermore, the firm did not act reasonably upon being informed that Representative A had advised certain clients to prematurely liquidate 23 variable annuity contracts, leading to $108,000 in surrender fees. Despite this information, Fortune permitted Representative A to continue recommending variable annuity exchanges, incurring further customer costs. This conduct led to violations of FINRA Rules 3110, 2330, and 2010. The document also suggests issues with another representative's email communications and lists customer-related financial details, although the latter's context is not fully visible.
