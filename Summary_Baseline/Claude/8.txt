The SEC found that Candlestick Capital Management violated Rule 105 of Regulation M by selling short shares of American Airlines stock within the restricted period before a follow-on offering, and then purchasing shares in the offering. Candlestick failed to qualify for the bona fide purchase exception. As a result, Candlestick's private fund clients obtained over $1.6 million in improper profits. Candlestick consented to the SEC's cease-and-desist order without admitting or denying the findings. Candlestick also agreed to pay an $810,000 penalty in a parallel case, while its funds agreed to pay over $1.7 million in disgorgement and interest.
