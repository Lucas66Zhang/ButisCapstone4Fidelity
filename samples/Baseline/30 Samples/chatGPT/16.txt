Webull Financial LLC (Webull) is under scrutiny by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for its alleged failure to establish, maintain, and enforce a supervisory system and written supervisory procedures (WSPs) reasonably designed to review and approve customer applications to trade options. Specifically, the firm did not consider customers' financial situation, investment experience, and knowledge while granting Level 3 options trading. Moreover, Webull did not adequately review its automated system for options trading approvals and approved customers for options trading despite them not meeting the firmâ€™s eligibility criteria or their accounts showing red flags indicating the inappropriateness of options trading. As a result of these findings, Webull is facing sanctions, the specifics of which are not fully visible in the truncated document. The agreement document is signed by Anthony Denier, Chief Executive Officer of Webull, and various representatives from FINRA.
