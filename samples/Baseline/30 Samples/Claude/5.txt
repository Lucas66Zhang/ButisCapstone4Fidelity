FINRA found that from January to March 2020, Quint Capital and its CEO Alexander Quint allowed an individual who was statutorily disqualified due to an SEC bar to associate with the firm and engage in municipal securities activities requiring registration. This occurred while the individual's membership continuance application was pending but not yet approved. As a result, Quint Capital was censured and fined $35,000, and Quint was suspended for 5 months in all principal capacities and fined $10,000. Quint Capital and Quint consented to FINRA's findings without admitting or denying them.
