Rosenblatt Securities Inc. ("Rosenblatt"), a member of FINRA since 1987, has been addressed in a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) by FINRA's Department of Enforcement. The firm, headquartered in New York, NY, with one branch office and approximately 60 registered representatives, is involved in the private placements of securities. The AWC alleges that from August 2018 to September 2021, Rosenblatt failed to timely file with FINRA any offering documents for 12 private offerings, violating FINRA Rule 5123. Moreover, during this period, the firm's supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures (WSPs), was not adequately designed to ensure compliance with FINRA Rule 5123, resulting in violations of FINRA Rules 5123, 3110, and 2010. The findings originated from FINRA's 2021 cycle examination of Rosenblatt. The firm has consented to the findings without admitting or denying them, and the AWC document concludes with signatures from representatives of both Rosenblatt and FINRA.
